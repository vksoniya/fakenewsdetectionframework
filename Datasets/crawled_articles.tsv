('poll bound assam', 0.6845)	India's Ruling BJP Says 'Massive Election Rallies' Led to Spike in COVID Cases, Faces Backlash	"Prominent Indian political parties, including the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition outfit Congress, continued to hold election meetings in five poll-bound states last month, despite an exponential surge in COVID infections. Some of these meetings were addressed by PM Narendra Modi and senior members of his Cabinet.

India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the opposition Congress Party of causing a spike in COVID cases by holding massive election rallies in the southern state of Kerala, in a letter written by BJP President Jagat Prakash Nadda to his opposition counterpart Sonia Gandhi.

""Your party, under your leadership, is doing no favours to itself by opposing lockdowns and demanding the for the same, ignoring the Centre's advisories on the second COVID wave and then saying that they didn't get any information, holding massive election rallies in Kerala and causing a spike in COVID cases while grandstanding about election rallies elsewhere, supporting protests but speaking about following COVID guidelines"", Nadda wrote in his letter on Tuesday.

Election meetings in four Indian states, Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Assam, as well as the Union Territory of Puducherry have often been blamed by experts for causing a spike in COVID cases in these regions and worsening India's second COVID surge. The five Indian regions held elections last month, with major outfits, including the BJP and Congress, holding public meetings to canvas voters.

A few of the meetings attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the second wave was ravaging the nation last month drew scathing reactions from opposition outfits as well as on social media.

The ""irony"" in Nadda's allegations that holding election meetings led to the spike in infections wasn't lost on social media users, who reminded the governing outfit of its own track record.

‚ÄãNadda also defended the government's vaccination policy in his letter to the Congress Party president, stating that the BJP governments in the states were providing vaccination free of cost to the poor while the opposition-ruled states were running away from their responsibilities.

""The Congress Working Committee talks about the Modi government discharging its responsibility to vaccinate. Is there such a difference of communication between the Congress Party and the states that it shares power? In April itself, top Congress leaders were calling for decentralisation of vaccination"", noted Nadda.

The BJP chief pointed out that the federal government has already handed out more than 160 million doses of vaccines to the states. ""Even now, it continues to give 50% of the total vaccines for free"", Nadda said.

Nadda also attacked prominent Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in his letter, remarking that he would be remembered for his ""pettiness"" and ""duplicity"" for regularly criticising Prime Minister Modi's COVID management skills in the ongoing second wave.

('poll bound assam', 0.6845)	Dissent within the Congress might get louder after poll debacle - Hindustan Times	"The Congress has yet again managed what it has been doing with nerve-wracking continuity---lose elections! Its comeuppance is heightened by the records its rivals set while beating back its late thrusts in Kerala and Assam.

In the states that witnessed direct fights, the Left Democratic Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party broke decades-old hoodoos to retain power. If in Kerala the Marxists-led LDF became the first political formation to win back-to-back, in Assam the BJP is the first non-Congress party to buck anti-incumbency.

Adding insult to the Congress‚Äôs injury in Bengal was the tectonic shift in the Opposition space, what with the victorious Trinamool obliterating its Sanjukta Morcha with the Left in their known sub-regional bastions. The default gainer: the otherwise humbled BJP that‚Äôll be the sole opposition in the new assembly where the indefatigable Mamata Banerjee will sit as a third-time chief minister.

The electorate retained rather than changed governments in three of the four assembly elections. In the big picture too, the Congress remained a speck. Its sole consolation, if it can be so described, was that of having a minority stake in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led front that won Tamil Nadu. There was no respite from bad news in the nearby Puducherry, where an uneasy Congress-DMK front got consigned to the margins, lending the BJP a toehold in partnership with the All India N Rangaswamy Congress (AINRC).

The pandemic the country‚Äôs battling in the aftermath of the polls robbed the results of their conventional sheen. That brings home the urgency for the incumbent-victors in Bengal, Assam and Kerala to prove their mettle in combating the virus--- to live down the infamy of contributing to its spread with rampant violations of Covid protocols during the campaign.

‚ÄúOur writ won‚Äôt run if the pandemic rages unremittingly and we fail to reach people the relief they need,‚Äù conceded a Trinamool MP from Bengal.

Disinclined to be named, he was unambiguous that the poll mandate will be incomplete without a win against the rampaging SARS-CoV-2. ‚ÄúOur ability to govern will be on test from the very start,‚Äù concurred a DMK legislator. Albeit a newcomer to the chief minister‚Äôs office, MK Stalin will have to hit the ground running.

If they deliver crisis-time governance in their states, they‚Äôd be heard with respect in Delhi. Be that as it may, the election outcome is bound to see the DMK and the Trinamool play a bigger role in Parliament, and thereby national politics, in any Opposition conjoint against the BJP--- which has its back to the wall in the face of all-round despair wrought by the pandemic.

For the Congress it brings home the imperative of setting its house in order regardless of who‚Äôs at the helm in the party. Rahul Gandhi undoubtedly was the only leader who consistently warned the Narendra Modi regime of the grave risks the pandemic posed to public health and the economy. But the Congress‚Äôs defeats in Assam and Kerala --the state he represents in Parliament‚Äîhave impacted his leadership prospects in the faction-ridden party. In Kerala the party‚Äôs ‚Äúbig failure‚Äù cannot even be attributed to the kind of communal polarisation it countenanced in Assam.

‚ÄúThe party workers will decide the leadership question. I‚Äôd play whatever role is assigned to me,‚Äù Gandhi said while supporting organisational polls in an interview to PTI-Bhasha on the eve of the election results that have since brought gloom to Congress circles.

In January, the Congress Working Committee resolved to have the new party president in office by June; a schedule that‚Äôll require reworking if the ongoing second wave of Covid lasts longer. But the big question is whether Gandhi will go by the workers‚Äô demand (which isn‚Äôt difficult to orchestrate) after having led the party to defeat in states where it was in the reckoning?

Pro-changers within the Congress have long held a view, at least privately, that Gandhi lacks the temperament and the ‚Äúpolitical timber‚Äù to lead the party towards the change it wants to see--- which is to become a credible alternative to the BJP. They agree that in the organisational set-up, he‚Äôd win if he decides to contest.

('poll bound assam', 0.6845)	Over 2,000 lawyers urge CJI to take cognizance of 'post-poll violence' in Bengal	"Over 2,000 advocates from across the country have written to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana urging him to take cognizance of the alleged incidents of violence in Bengal after the assembly election in the state. They have also demanded the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate and register FIRs in the matter.

The letter was written to draw the attention of the Supreme Court ""towards the constitutional crisis and deplorable condition of the citizens of our country residing in the State of West Bengal due to the post-poll violence continuing since May 2"".

""The incidents of violence have shackled the conscience of thousands of women lawyers across the length and breadth of ‚ÄòBharat‚Äô,"" the letter read.

Alleging the state police were complicit in the alleged violence, the letter said, ""The police are hand in gloves with the goons and the victims are not in a position to even register their complaints. There is a complete breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the State.""

The lawyers urged the CJI to ""take cognizance of the matter and constitute a Special Investigation Team to register FIRs and investigate into the deaths and other vengeful attacks as being reported in news.""

The lawyers demanded that ""A nodal officer be appointed (not belonging to West Bengal Police) to register the complaints of the victims. A court-monitored investigation in a time-bound manner, trial by specially constituted fast track court wherever charge sheet is filed by the SIT regarding cases emanating from the post-poll violence in the State of West Bengal. Directions are issued that all post-poll violence victims/family members may be duly compensated for death /injuries, loss of property, etc. by the State of West Bengal.""

The lawyers said, ""Director General of Police of the State of West Bengal may kindly be directed to set up an effective complaint mechanism at all levels on priority basis and to file a daily report before the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court, regarding the complaints received by Police Department from all channels.""

The lawyers also sought that protection is provided to all victims and directions be issued to the DGP in the matter.

They also sought that ""directions may be issued to all Commissions i.e National Human Rights Commission, National Commission for Women, National Commission for protection of Child Rights, Commission of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, National Commission for Backward classes to appoint competent nodal officers to record the statements of victims through virtual mode and contact numbers of those nodal officers be widely circulated.""

RETIRED JUDGES, DIPLOMATS, WRITE TO PREZ AGAINST 'POLITICAL VIOLENCE' IN WEST BENGAL

Blaming ""state terror"" for political violence in West Bengal, a group of citizens has written to President Ram Nath Kovind and called for a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe monitored by a retired Supreme Court judge for a fair investigation and speedy justice.

Referring to the ""targeted political killings"" and violence after the West Bengal assembly elections and ""deficient and inappropriate"" response of the local administration and police, they demanded that these cases be handed over to the NIA to deal with the ""anti-national"" onslaught on the culture and integrity of the country as it is a border state.

Nearly 150 people, including retired judges, diplomats, bureaucrats, police officials and veterans, have submitted this memorandum to the president on Monday.

The memorandum said, ""We are greatly disturbed by the mindless instigation of reported violence in electoral vengeance against the people who exercised their democratic right to vote for one political party or the other.

""Media reports, largely substantiated by eyewitness accounts, mention murders, rapes, attacks on persons and property, including by anti-national elements, leading to forced migration of people to shelter homes.""

These unfortunate developments, if unchecked, could establish a trend which will undermine and ultimately destroy the deep-rooted democratic traditions of India, they said.

Citing media reports, they said over a dozen persons, including women, have been killed in post-poll violence in the state in over 15,000 incidents of alleged violence.

As a result, 4,000 to 5,000 people have reportedly migrated to Assam, Jharkhand and Orissa, they said, seeking a special relief package for the victims of violence, and efforts for their rehabilitation.

The BJP has blamed the state's ruling Trinamool Congress for the violence, while the TMC has accused the saffron party of politicising incidents of violence in which, it has said, its workers have also lost lives. The state government has also refuted the allegations of large-scale violence.

Former Delhi High Court chief justice BC Patel, former Bombay High Court chief justice Kshitij Vyas, former RAW chief Sanjeev Tripathi, former Punjab DGP PC Dogra and former Jammu and Kashmir DGP SP Vaid are among the signatories to the memorandum."	https://www.indiatoday.in/law/story/bengal-post-poll-violence-lawyers-write-to-cji-1806599-2021-05-25	"READ: Bengal post-poll violence: BJP workers, activists move SC, seek SIT probeThe lawyers urged the CJI to ""take cognizance of the matter and constitute a Special Investigation Team to register FIRs and investigate into the deaths and other vengeful attacks as being reported in news.""

('poll bound assam', 0.6845)	Up to 530% spike in poll states, 152% after Holi ‚Äî the big culprits in India's new Covid wave	"Text Size: A- A+

New Delhi: As India is overwhelmed by the Covid-19 second wave and states that have just elected new (or old) governments to power are among the worst-hit, data shows that the numbers surged significantly in a fortnight from the polling days in all states.

What‚Äôs more, India‚Äôs apparent denial of the prospect of a second wave also meant that Holi 2021 had none of the restraint of Holi 2020 when a Twitter appeal from Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ensured that India observed a hunkered-down Holi.

The result: A 152 per cent jump in the number of active cases between 29 March, the day of Holi, and 13 April.

A fortnight accounts for the average lag of about 15 days between diagnosis and death for a Covid-19 patient in India.

Massive jump during elections

But whether it be a religious festival or one of democracy, the onslaught of the SARS-CoV2 virus has been relentless.

Active cases in Kerala rose by 349 per cent from 30,228 on 6 April ‚Äî the day of the single-phase assembly elections ‚Äî to 1,35,910 on 21 April. Tamil Nadu, which voted on the same day as its neighbour, saw a 229 per cent jump over the same period to 84,361 cases.

In tiny Puducherry, the active cases shot up by 204 per cent to 5,404 cases during this same interval.

Assam voted in three phases ‚Äî on 27 March, 1 April and 6 April. Obviously in states with multi-phased elections, electioneering continued in other parts of the state even when one part had voted or was in the 48-hour no-campaign period.

Active cases in Assam went up by 83 per cent from 27 March to 11 April, by 187 per cent from 1 April to 16 April and by 344 per cent between 6 April and 20 April.

This came in a state where the most important minister, Health and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had declared that there is no need for masks because Assam is free from Covid.

The picture is similar in bitterly fought West Bengal, where the full brunt of the last three phases of the eight-phase elections will become clear only in the coming days.

Between 27 March and 11 April, active cases in Bengal went up more than four times from 4,608 to 23,981 ‚Äî a jump of 420 per cent. Between 1 April (second phase) and 16 April, cases went up almost seven times from 6,513 to 41,047 ‚Äî a jump of 530 per cent.

Between the third phase on 6 April and a fortnight later on 20 April, cases went up almost five times from 12,775 to 58,386. That was a jump of 357 per cent. The fourth phase of elections happened on 10 April. By 25 April the active cases went up by 315 per cent from 21,366 to 88,800 ‚Äî another four-fold jump.

On 17 April, when the fifth phase of polling happened, active cases in West Bengal stood at 45,300. On 2 May, it went up to 1,18,945, in a 162 per cent jump.

The rising Covid numbers have caused alarm bells across the country. An irate Madras HC last month said that the Election Commission of India had been ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù and should ‚Äúface murder charges‚Äù.

‚ÄòElections may have affected Covid management‚Äô

While the link between super-spreader events and a surge in Covid-19 numbers has been established time and again throughout the world, experts also point out that in a poll-bound state, there is also the contingency that the government machinery is too caught up in the election process to do Covid management with all its might.

‚ÄúAny super-spreader event will facilitate spread. Holi or election, most people do not follow distancing and masking and this may have led to higher transmission. However you also have to consider the possibility that after elections there may have been a surge in testing,‚Äù said said Dr Giridhara Babu, professor and head, lifecourse epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.

‚ÄúDuring elections sometimes it happens that the amount of time you have to review the programme is reduced, Covid takes a backseat once the main focus elections. Health workers may have been on election duty too, that would have caused some amount of lack of focus on Covid response during the elections,‚Äù said Babu.

He added that there is a need to compare the surge in these states or in others and link mass congregations to Covid numbers to better understand the genesis and nature of the Covid-19 second wave in India.

('poll bound assam', 0.6845)	Assam NRC co-ordinator moves SC seeking reverification of final claims anomalies	"Tackling a major poll agenda in Assam, the state coordinator for the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) on Thursday, has approached the Supreme Court seeking a comprehensive and time-bound re-verification of draft NRC and the supplementary list of NRC. In a plea in the Supreme Court, the Assam co-ordinator claimed that there were some 'glaring anomalies of serious nature' in the process as there has been no back-end verification in the preparation of electoral rolls. While the NRC Final list was released in August 2019, the state is yet to officially notify those excluded from the list.

Assam NRC coordinator approaches SC, seeks re-verification

The Assam NRC coordinator stated, ""Out of names of 40,07,719 persons excluded from the Draft NRC, about 3,93,975 persons did not file any claims and therefore their names are excluded. After sample checks of those who did not file claims, 50,695 persons were apparently eligible for inclusion in the NRC. Moreover, 7,770 persons are from Originally Inhabitants category and 42,925 persons are from Persons from other States,"" in its SC plea. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had promised a re-verification after the Final NRC list excluded 19 lakh individuals - of which 7 lakh were Muslims and others were mainly Hindus.

The final NRC list

On August 31, 2019, the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) state coordinator's office released the final NRC list. 3,11,21,004 Assam residents have been found eligible, while 19,06,657 Assam residents have been found ineligible. The exclusion includes the number of people who did not submit their papers to the NRC authorities. The 19 lakh exclusion is a major decrease from the over 40 lakh excluded in the second draft published on July 2018.

The state coordinator stated that those not satisfied with the outcome can file an appeal before Foreigners Tribunals. Moreover, the state govt assured that those excluded do not become a 'foreigner' and that the state would provide legal aid to needy people excluded by the NRC. The state also gave 120 days to the people who were excluded to appeal to the tribunals, assuring that the number of tribunals had been increased to aid citizens. Those deemed 'foreigners' by the tribunals will be sent to detention camps. Amid the onslaught Coronavirus (COVID-19), Assam's NRC officials did not issue official notice rejecting the excluded population's citizenship. Without an official notice of rejection, these 19 lakh individuals cannot approach govt-appointed 'foreigners' tribunals to challenge the final list.

The final list had disappointed BJP and left most Bengali residents aghast. BJP's Assam Home Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had alleged that over 5 lakh Hindu Bengalis were excluded from the list and that they would be given citizenship by the state by 2021. Reports estimate that of the 19 lakh excluded -7 lakh were Muslims, which has led to Assam BJP, AASU oppose the process - leading to violent protests. Moreover, the BJP has batted for a nationwide NRC which has been vehemently opposed by most states.

What is NRC?

The NRC was first prepared in 1951 under the purview of the Census Act, 1948. In 2013, a special Supreme Court bench headed by Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Rohinton Fali Nariman ordered the State Government to carry out an updation process. This ended with the receipt of forms by the NRC authorities on 31 August 2015. The process under SC's supervision aimed at separating genuine Indian citizens from undocumented immigrants living in Assam and cost a staggering Rs 1,200 crore. As per NRC terms, a resident has to prove that they or their ancestors entered Assam before midnight on March 24, 1971."	https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/law-and-order/assam-nrc-co-ordinator-moves-sc-seeking-reverification-of-final-list-claims-anomalies.html	"While the NRC Final list was released in August 2019, the state is yet to officially notify those excluded from the list.

While it drew a blank in West Bengal, Congress failed to prevent the BJP government from coming back to power in Assam despite forging a formidable alliance of opposition parties. Though it managed to be a part of the winning alliance led by DMK in Tamil Nadu, it suffered a huge setback in Kerala as the LDF became the first incumbent government in the state after 40 years to retain power.

In another embarrassment to the Sonia Gandhi-led party, it could bag only two seats in Puducherry as against that of BJP that won 6 seats. The Rae Bareli MP stated, ""To say that we are deeply disappointed is an understatement. I intend to set up a small group to look at every aspect that caused such reverses and report back very quickly"". She added, ""These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not face up to the reality, if we do not look at the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons"".

Thereafter, she asked the general secretaries of the poll-bound states of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and West Bengal to make their presentations on the reasons for the party's poor performance. She also announced that the process for electing a new Congress president would be completed by end of June.

On this occasion, she also delved into the COVID-19 situation and called for rapidly expanding the vaccination coverage.

Turmoil in Congress

In a letter addressed to Sonia Gandhi on August 23, 2020, 23 senior party leaders observed that the uncertainly over the leadership and the drift in the party have weakened Congress and demoralized the workers. The letter reportedly mentioned many suggestions such as the need for a full-time leadership available at the national and state headquarters, conducting elections at all levels including the Congress Working Committee and state level, the formation of an Independent Election Authority, and institutional leadership mechanism to guide the party's revival. Despite the high-octane drama at the CWC meeting, it was decided that the Rae Bareli MP will continue as the interim president at least until the next AICC session is convened.

But the concerns were reiterated by Congress leaders such as Kapil Sibal, P Chidambaram and Ghulam Nabi Azad after the loss in the Bihar Assembly election. Far from addressing concerns, the CWC in January stated that the election to the post of party president will be held only after the conclusion of the Assembly polls in Assam, Puducherry, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The internal rift in the party widened after dissenting leaders such as Azad, Anand Sharma, Raj Babbar, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Kapil Sibal and Manish Tewari addressed a joint rally in Jammu on February 27.

Sidhana who is accused of perpetrating the Red Fort violence, said that this act will convey the anger of the people to the government and it must reach every corner of Punjab. Sidhana has been absconding since January 26 and has a bounty of Rs 1 lakh by Delhi police.

Thousands gather at Singhu Border

On Tuesday, thousands of protestors led by Rakesh Tikait gathered at Hisar's 'Kranti Ground' to protest the clash between the police and them on May 16, violating COVID norms. The farmers have also demanded that the FIRs that were filed against 350 farmers should be taken by the police. Last Sunday, protesting farmers moved from the border areas to Haryana where Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was inaugurating a 500-bed hospital leading to violent clashes and state police using lathi-charge and tear-gas on protestors.

Farmers have announced that they will stage an all-India protest against the Centre's Farm Laws on May 26 to mark the six months of the protest. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will observe a 'black day' on May 26 from 9 AM on Wednesday and end by 12 PM. Assuring that there will be 'no crowding or public meeting', Tikait said that people 'will put up the flags wherever they are'. NHRC has issued otices to the Chief Secretaries of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi over the mass gatherings and alleged flouting of COVID-19 appropriate norms. 13 Opposition parties have backed the protests.

Farmers protests

Taking a political twist to the protests, Tikait and other BKU leaders toured poll-bound Assam, Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry seeking farmers' support against the Centre's Farm Laws, urging them to not vote for BJP. Moreover, after the violence witnessed on Republic Day, Delhi police fortified the city borders by cementing nails near barricades, deploying additional troops, adding barbed wires etc at Ghazipur (Delhi-Uttar Pradesh) and Tikri (Delhi-Haryana) borders, blocking access to the roads completely. MHA had snapped off internet across all three border areas - Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur and later extended the ban to 1-2 days more. Farmers have reiterated 'No Ghar Wapsi till Law Wapsi', as the 3-month protests have caught several international celebrities' interest online.

('assam stop bengal', 0.656)	India's COVID-19 cases near 20 million, peak seen nearing - Reuters	"India postponed exams for trainee doctors and nurses on Monday, freeing them up to fight the world‚Äôs biggest surge in coronavirus infections, as the health system crumbles under the weight of new cases and hospitals run out of beds and oxygen.

The total number of infections so far rose to just short of 20 million, propelled by a 12th straight day of more than 300,000 new cases in a pandemic sparked by a virus first identified in central China at the end of 2019.

Medical experts say actual numbers in India could be five to 10 times higher than those reported.

Hospitals have filled to capacity, supplies of medical oxygen have run short, and morgues and crematoriums have been overloaded with corpses. Patients are dying on hospital beds, in ambulances and in carparks outside.

loading

""Every time we have to struggle to get our quota of our oxygen cylinders,"" said B.H. Narayan Rao, a district official in the southern town of Chamarajanagar, where 24 COVID-19 patients died, some from a suspected shortage of oxygen supplies.

""It's a day-to-day fight,"" added Rao, as he described the hectic scramble for supplies.

In many cases, volunteer groups have come to the rescue.

Outside a temple in the capital, New Delhi, Sikh volunteers were providing oxygen to patients lying on benches inside makeshift tents, hooked up to a giant cylinder. Every 20 minutes or so, a new patient came in.

""No one should die because of a lack of oxygen. It's a small thing otherwise, but nowadays, it is the one thing every one needs,"" Gurpreet Singh Rummy, who runs the service, told Reuters.

Total infections since the start of the pandemic have reached 19.93 million in India, swelled by 368,147 new cases over the past 24 hours, while the death toll rose by 3,417 to 218,959, health ministry data showed. At least 3.4 million people are currently being treated.

Offering a glimmer of hope, the health ministry said positive cases relative to the number of tests fell on Monday for the first time since at least April 15.

Modelling by a team of government advisers shows coronavirus cases could peak by Wednesday this week, a few days earlier than a previous estimate, since the virus has spread faster than expected.

At least 11 states and regions have ordered curbs on movement to stem infections, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, widely criticised for allowing the crisis to spin out of control, is reluctant to announce a national lockdown, concerned about the economic impact.

""In my opinion, only a national stay at home order and declaring medical emergency will help to address the current healthcare needs,"" Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist with the University of Michigan, said on Twitter.

CRISIS TESTS MODI

As medical facilities near breaking point, the government postponed an exam for doctors and nurses to allow some to join the coronavirus battle alongside existing personnel, it said in a statement.

In Pune, the second-largest city in the state of Maharashtra, Dr. Mekund Penurkar returned to work just days after losing his father to COVID-19. His mother and brother are in hospital with the virus, but patients are waiting to see him.

""It is a very difficult situation,"" he said. ""Because I have been through such a situation myself, I can't leave other patients to their fate.""

Modi has been criticised for not moving sooner to limit the spread and for letting millions of largely unmasked people attend religious festivals and crowded political rallies in five states during March and April.

In early March, a forum of government scientific advisers warned officials of a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus taking hold, five of its members told Reuters.

Despite the warning, four of the scientists said the federal government did not seek to impose major curbs.

With the next general election due in 2024, it remains to be seen how the pandemic might affect him or his party. His Hindu nationalist party was defeated on Sunday in a state poll in the eastern state of West Bengal, although it won in the neighbouring state of Assam.

Leaders of 13 opposition parties urged Modi in a letter on Sunday to immediately launch free national vaccinations and to prioritise oxygen supplies to hospitals and health centres.

Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, India does not have enough for itself. Just 9% of a population of 1.35 billion has received a dose.

Daily shots have fallen sharply from an all-time high reached early last month as domestic companies struggle to boost supplies. Vaccination centres in Mumbai were deserted after the state government said it did not have enough supplies to administer second doses for adults above 45.

Only limited doses were available for those aged 18-44 and no walk-ins were allowed.

India has struggled to increase capacity beyond 80 million doses a month due to a lack of raw materials and a fire at the Serum Institute, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Another manufacturer, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is in talks with the government for ‚Äúexpedited approval‚Äù of its vaccine, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on LinkedIn, announcing a donation of medicines worth more than $70 million.

Last month, India said its drugs regulator would hand down a decision within three days on emergency-use applications for foreign vaccines, including that of Pfizer.

International aid has poured in in response to the crisis.

Britain will send another 1,000 ventilators to India, the government said on Sunday. Prime ministers Boris Johnson and Modi are set to talk on Tuesday.

The Indian COVID-19 variant has now reached at least 17 countries including Britain, Iran and Switzerland, spurring several nations to close their borders to travellers from India.

('assam stop bengal', 0.656)	Post-poll violence in Bengal must stop	"TMC activists celebrate winning trend in the West Bengal state assembly elections, in Kolkata, Sunday, May 2, 2021. There have been reports of widespread violence in the state with both the BJP and TMC accusing each other of attacking its cadre. (Photo: PTI)

A political party came second and another political party came first in an election in an Indian state. Nothing new or newsworthy here. Of course, elections keep happening in our vibrant democracy.

But wait, that‚Äôs not the news. The news is that the political party that came second is having to set up helplines and publicise its phone numbers among its workers. During a pandemic, one might think that these are helplines for COVID-affected but they are not. These are helplines for workers impacted by the violence unleashed on its party workers after the election results were announced.

This shameful development has happened after TMC won the elections in West Bengal.

There are four other states or union territories where election results have been announced but such vendetta and vindictive violence have not been reported from there.

Kerala is also known for political violence but things seem to be peaceful there. Assam is seeing nothing untoward despite a high-octane election campaign. Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are peaceful. But it is only in TMC-ruled Bengal that homes are being burnt, BJP workers are being lynched and mobs are taking over the streets. The unleashing of violence to target political opponents that acquired a new level of viciousness during the 2018 panchayat polls continues.

There were ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù waxing eloquent about the ‚Äúvictory of federalism‚Äù and ‚Äúvictory of the idea of India‚Äù when the eventual results of the Bengal elections were announced. It has now been made clear to us what it means for the country.

It cannot be articulated more clearly that ‚Äúfederalism‚Äù and ‚Äúidea of India‚Äù mean that mobs will prowl around the houses of people who associate themselves with the BJP, a legitimate political party that has won the votes of crores of people. Lofty jargon is just intellectual cover for violence on the streets by which the liberal elite of the country seeks to tighten its loosening grip over the electorate.

If bullying the electorate is the ‚Äúidea of India‚Äù, then it is an existential danger for our democracy.

If this is what the TMC resorts to after winning, imagine the kind of chaos Mamata Banerjee would have unleashed if she had lost. She would have surely put Donald Trump and his supporters who swamped Capitol Hill to shame.

In contrast, the BJP which jumped from nearly nothing to 77 seats in Bengal, humbly accepted the verdict of the people. They did not question the EVMs, did not point fingers and neither did they allege any malpractice.

While the party that came second is showing grace, the party that is forming the government is baring its fangs on the streets. Mamata Banerjee was issuing veiled threats of ‚Äúlooking after‚Äù her opponents after the elections and her lumpen cadre are following up on them now.

This is a litmus test for principled politicians of all hues. Politics exists because democracy and free choice exist. When democracy is threatened, if someone thinks they will choose tactical silence because they are not at the receiving end, then they misunderstand the dangers of anti-democratic lumpenism. Once the precedent is set, it will not take too much time for mobs to reach other doors.

From the media to the Governor of the state, everyone is appalled at what is happening in Bengal but other political parties are silent.

In any case, nobody expects other parties of the national Opposition to stand up and save democracy in Bengal. They could have said they have no stake in it if they had not issued glowing tributes to Mamata Banerjee. The Congress party went one step ahead and even disowned the efforts of their own Bengal unit. So what if their own house is on fire, it matters to them that BJP workers are being ‚Äútaught a lesson‚Äù. But now, the blood that is being spilt on the streets of Bengal is on their hands too, given that they identify themselves with Mamata Banerjee‚Äôs vindictive politics.

At such times, one only has to derive strength from the courage of the common BJP worker who went out to the streets to work for her convictions, despite suspecting that such violence would be unleashed at her for simply performing her role in democracy.

It is to protect the same workers that something needs to be done. TMC cadre and the leaders who egg them on must be given a stern message by any means possible. Because there are lives at stake.

West Bengal cannot be allowed to be run like a tinpot dictatorship where any political activism that the ‚ÄúSupreme Leader‚Äù does not approve of will be met with violence on the streets.

The Left Front, which had ruled West Bengal for 34 years, has failed to open its account in this election.

The Left Front comprising the Communist Party of India (Marxist), All India Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Communist Party of India had a legacy in West Bengal and was one of the longest-serving elected governments in the world.

There is a pandemic and millions were exposed to a deadly virus and that is just wrong. Not just that, despite a win I will say that the Election Commission blatantly gave an open hand to BJP to do whatever they want without being penalised. Also the factor of religious polarisation - there was large-scale polarisation across Bengal and the Election Commission, which must ensure that doesn't happen, did nothing about it,"" political strategist Prashant Kishor told NDTV.

So, Mamata Banerjee has pulled back the margin somewhat, but it is still a cause of concern for her. However, counting is happening in Nandigram block-1, where there is a mixed population of all communities. Trinamool sources said when counting happens in Nandigram block-2, which is dominated by the minority community, Ms Banerjee will go past Mr Adhikari.""

May 02, 2021 13:19 (IST) West Bengal election: ""3 things worked for Mamata Banerjee,"" says expert

""Three things have worked for Mamata Banerjee - 1. Playing the underdog. It has worked in the past for Indira Gandhi and more recently Arvind Kejriwal... now it has worked for Mamata Banerjee, who was seen in a wheelchair, being targeted by big leaders day and night. The underdog has given a stupendous performance. 2. The second thing that has worked for Mamata Banerjee is the consolidation of the minority votes. The BJP went so strongly with its Hindutva that the anxious minority community came together. That is something BJP must learn about states with a large minority population - that it must not go so strong with Hindutva. That being said, the Congress has been completely decimated in Bengal with Mamata Banerjee walking away with the complete minority vote. And 3. COVID-19 surge went against the BJP. The last three phases of election saw a huge Covid factor playing against the BJP, and Mamata Banerjee capitalised on it. If you see the last three phases of elections, the BJP's performance completely dropped,"" political commentator Arati Jerath told NDTV.

May 02, 2021 12:48 (IST) Election results 2021: Expert view

""I agree with N Ram, that Mamata Banerjee must focus on her governance. Bengal was a poorly governed state and had lot of issues like that of corruption and cut money. So, despite a win, the Trinamool must focus on improving Bengal. That being said, the BJP will surely hold them to task because the BJP is a formidable opposition wherever it is,"" political commentator Arati Jerath told NDTV.

""Mamata Banerjee, however, must focus on her governance from here on. There was a lot of discontent among the people of Bengal.

May 02, 2021 11:01 (IST) BJP's test in Malda and Murshidabad

The districts of Malda and Murshidabad, where Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had campaigned extensively, seem not to be working well for the BJP. The Trinamool Congress is keeping a close eye on this fact. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP had made inroads in these districts, and they were quite confident of doing well in these districts, but that does not seem to be the case. But these districts are mainly minority dominated and so the BJP was never really confident about it. The BJP, however, wanted to capitalise on the inroads made by it during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and that is something that Trinamool is looking at closely.



May 02, 2021 10:52 (IST) ""BJP certainly made inroads in Bengal""

""Irrespective of the final result in Bengal, whether they emerge victorious or not, one thing is certain, that the BJP has successfully made massive inroads in Bengal - something that they had long aspired.

She was trailing in postal ballots by around 1,500 votes and now with EVMs being counted too, Mr Adhikari's lead has grown to around 7,000 votes. However, this is the counting from Nandigram-1 - where the minority community votes are not a factor. Nandigram-2 is where the minority community plays a big factor and that is where Ms Banerjee looks to gain most from.

Questioning the silence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the post-election attacks directed at the BJP workers, party national president J.P. Nadda on Wednesday said 14 workers of the party had been killed in the violence so far and about one lakh people had been affected.

This is a matter of grave concern for us but the BJP strands strongly with every party worker,‚Äù he said at a press conference in the city.

Mr. Nadda, who is on a two-day visit to the State, described the attacks as ‚ÄúState-sponsored violence‚Äù also raised questions why the champions of human rights were silent on the attacks.

The BJP president said the BJP with 77 seats and over 37% votes will play a role of responsible Opposition. Post-election violence started from the evening of May 2, when the counting of votes was on.

At a time when the Chief Minister was being administered the oath, the BJP leaders including the elected representatives sat in protests at the party headquarters in the city.

Mr. Nadda, who over the past few days has met the family members of the BJP supporters killed, said in some parts of the State like Sandeshkhali and Gosaba entire villages have been ransacked. He said people have even fled from Cooch Behar district to neighbouring Assam to save their lives.

Asked whether the BJP was contemplating to seek imposition of Article 356 in West Bengal, Mr. Nadda said the prescribed procedure is that a report is generated by the Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs takes a decision on this.

More than 14.58 lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in India on May 21, the Union Health Ministry's latest provisional report suggested. With that, the cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country reached 19.33 crore.

On the 126th day of the vaccination drive (May 21), 12.71 lakh beneficiaries received their first shot and 1.87 lakh people were given their second dose.

The government has revised the gap between the two doses for the Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, to 12-16 weeks. However, the interval for the second dose of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin remains unchanged.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the nationwide vaccination drive on January 16, with healthcare workers at the frontline of India's COVID-19 battle getting their first jabs. The country began the second phase of the vaccination drive from March 1 in which everyone above 60 years of age and those over 45 years with comorbidities could start getting the vaccine.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine ‚Äî one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

From April 1, vaccination was opened for everyone above the age of 45 with or without comorbidities.

India rolled out the third phase of its COVID-19 vaccination drive for those in the 18-44 age group on May 1. The central government has liberalised the vaccination drive to allow states, private hospitals and industrial establishments to procure the doses directly from manufacturers.

Registration on CoWIN platform for the third phase began on April 28 and is mandatory for the 18-44 age group.

Here are key developments related to the COVID-19 vaccination process:

> Amid an acute shortage of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, executive director of Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) Suresh Jadhav on May 21 alleged that the government began inoculating people from multiple age groups without taking into account the available stock of vaccines and the WHO guidelines. Speaking at an e-summit organised by Heal Health, a health advocacy and awareness platform, Jadhav said the country should have followed the WHO guidelines and prioritised vaccination accordingly.

> The Delhi government will have to temporarily stop the inoculation drive for the 18-44 age group from May 24, as it has almost run out of vaccines for this category, AAP MLA Atishi said.

> In an effort to facilitate more bidders to take part in the global tender for COVID-19 vaccine procurement by the Odisha government, the state Cabinet amended certain terms and condition in the tender documents, an official said. The amended approval in this regard was made at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.

> The total count of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Delhi crossed the 50 lakh-mark, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said.

> Delay in giving second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine by 12 weeks increases antibody response in older people by three-and-a-half times compared to those who receive it at a three-week interval, according to a study conducted in the UK. The finding comes days after the UK government reduced the gap between the two doses of COVID-19 vaccines to eight weeks, while India extended the interval between two doses of the Covishield preventive to 12-16 weeks, up from the previous maximum of eight weeks.

> The Karnataka government will resume the COVID-19 vaccination drive for people in the 18-44 years age group from May 22. The frontline workers will be the first to receive the doses followed by other eligible groups, the state government said in an order.

('pm launches key', 0.6096)	SpaceX launched 52 more Starlink satellites to orbit on Saturday	"SpaceX successfully launched another 52 Starlink internet broadband satellites into orbit on Saturday, less than one week after it sent up the last batch. A small satellite from startup Capella Space and a Tyvak observation satellite also hitched a ride on the launch, which took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday evening.

The launch used a veteran Falcon 9 booster that‚Äôs seen seven previous launch and landings, including during three Starlink missions. It departed from its launch pad at 6:56 PM ET (3:56 PM PT) and returned to Earth approximately nine minutes later. The rocket landed vertically on SpaceX‚Äôs autonomous drone ship ‚ÄúOf Course I Still Love You‚Äù in the Atlantic Ocean.

The launch company has now sent more than 530 Starlink satellites to space since March, and all of them on reused rockets. Reusability is a key factor toward making the launches as cost-effective as possible, a factor that is especially important as SpaceX is both the launch provider and customer of the Starlink service. As a consequence, SpaceX has been able to rapidly accelerate its Starlink launch program, with 28 launches under its belt so far. At least one additional launch is likely in the works for later this month.

The company said earlier this month that it had received ‚Äúover half a million‚Äù pre-order reservations for Starlink broadband service so far. Starlink is available in beta to customers in six countries: Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada.

Don‚Äôt procrastinate ‚Äî the experience alone, whether you win the $100,000 prize or not, can improve the trajectory of your business.

Case in point: Mollie Breen started out as a mathematician at the National Security Agency before co-founding an IoT/OT security startup called Perygee. She and her team competed in Startup Battlefield last year at Disrupt 2020. Although they didn‚Äôt reach the finals, Breen has plenty to say about the experience. Here‚Äôs what she shared with us in a quick Q&A.

TC: Why did you apply to Startup Battlefield?

Breen: I admired the leadership and growth of other companies that, at one point, were Startup Battlefield contestants. I noticed they had similar traction to us when they applied, and their products resembled ours in their ability to disrupt the respective industry.

TC: What was the training process like?

Breen: It was incredibly valuable both in the short term and long term. Every team gets a weekly session with the Battlefield editor. Together you rehearse and go over every iteration of the pitch line-by-line and slide-by-slide. After each session, I walked away with constructive feedback on everything ‚Äî the content, the speaking style and even the font color on a particular slide.

This was a unique opportunity, and we put in extra hours to be ahead of schedule, sent drafts for review in the off hours and even doubled down on additional practice with Q&As. As a result, we couldn‚Äôt have been more prepared for pitch day. And the training has stayed with Perygee well past the sessions and the competition.

TC: What did it feel like to pitch at Disrupt?

Breen: Pitching at Disrupt was, in some ways, like other pitches except that you have an international audience. Since, at that point, we had practiced our pitch dozens of times, the real unknown during the competition was the Q&A with the VC judges.

There was additional pressure to answer succinctly and convincingly within a time constraint that you wouldn‚Äôt have during a normal one-on-one pitch. But with the prep help from the TechCrunch team, I felt ready to speak in front of such a large audience. I encourage anyone who might be nervous about the big stage to go for it and trust you‚Äôll have more than enough preparation when you get there.

TC: What was the post-pitch impact? Did you meet investors, press or other key partners?

Breen: It helped accelerate our progress. Following Battlefield, we closed an oversubscribed fundraising round. We acquired additional beta users, including our first beta user who messaged us after reading about Perygee on TechCrunch. We also gained numerous press opportunities to share our story.

It‚Äôs almost a year since Startup Battlefield, and I‚Äôm still impressed by how many people start the conversation saying they watched the pitch while reading our company‚Äôs background. It‚Äôs a reminder that the opportunities created by being a TechCrunch Battlefield company continue.

TC: Do you have any great news to share since your pitch?

Breen: At TechCrunch Battlefield we were a small team doing MVP testing and just about to start raising. Since the pitch, we have scaled on all fronts. We grew the founding team and the engineering team, and we deployed the product to enterprise networks. Some of those deployments include contacts who reached out because of TechCrunch ‚Äî and we raised our seed round!

TC: Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?

Breen: I‚Äôm grateful for the camaraderie and relationships we developed with the other teams. What you didn‚Äôt see on stage during the pitches was all of us cheering one another on from the group chat or social media feed. Even now, we continue to support one another through navigating business questions or promoting product launches. If it weren‚Äôt for Startup Battlefield, I would never have met this awesome group of startups.

Facebook and Instagram apps will let you hide the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù counts

Facebook this week will begin to publicly roll out the option to hide Likes on posts across both Facebook and Instagram, following earlier tests beginning in 2019. The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company‚Äôs global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook‚Äôs part. When the company tested how people felt about Like counts, it got pushback from both sides ‚Äî some wanted to see this information and others felt it was leading to a negative, competitive experience.

The company decided to split the difference and put the decision in its users‚Äô hands. Via new settings, users can choose to disable Like counts on the posts they make and those that appear when they browse the social apps‚Äô feeds.

The decision, however, indicates not one of user empowerment, but rather one representative of a company that‚Äôs so large (and intent on remaining the largest), it declines to have its own point of view on controversial matters for fear of causing a mass exit. You can see this in other areas of the business as well, like how it wanted to downplay its responsibility with regard to the misinformation it recirculated by leaving it to fact-checkers to handle, or how it offloaded hard decisions about takedowns to an advisory board. While it‚Äôs one thing to not want to piss off a large number of users, turning every toggle and setting into a user choice is just another way at shrugging off responsibility while claiming that something has been done.

Poparazzi hypes and growth hacks to the top

Meanwhile, a new app with its own point of view has made it to the top. Recently launched anti-selfie app Poparazzi sees itself as a referendum on the Instagram age of performative and self-obsessed social media. The app turns the ‚Äútag your friends in photos‚Äù feature from Instagram into a standalone, excellently marketed and growth-hacked app experience.

Your Poparazzi profile can only be added to by your friends, which makes the app feel more authentic as it captures casual, unpolished moments, not those you‚Äôve rehearsed and filtered to perfection. But the viral app favors giving up some user privacy protections for network effects, which could potentially be harmful. In the end, it also overlooks why people use social media today: self-expression. Posting pictures to other profiles doesn‚Äôt fulfill that desire. That means the app either become an additive experience to be used alongside your existing preferred social app, or one that‚Äôs risking a bet on a future where people are actually less self-involved. We can only hope.

Apple-Epic trial officially adjourns

As the Apple-Epic App Store antitrust trial adjourns, the judge seemed leaning more to Epic‚Äôs point of view on specific matters, including the 30% cut Apple takes and its decision to ban companies from telling their customers where they could get a better deal on an in-app purchase. (Tim Cook taking the stand only to claim ignorance of certain key aspects of the App Store business didn‚Äôt help matters, either.)

At its core, the case is about whether or not Apple is a monopoly and could set the tone for later lawsuits and government regulation. Epic believes Apple has a monopoly over distribution to the iPhone, but Apple argued there were plenty of other places for a company like Epic to sell its games ‚Äî including those that Epic pays a cut to without complaint, like Microsoft and Sony. Epic, meanwhile, argued that its metaverse is more than just a game, it‚Äôs a social place to hang out.

The judge pointed out both Epic‚Äôs plain-as-day ulterior motives (hint: $$$$), but also the extent to which mobile games ‚Äî games that make up the lion‚Äôs share of App Store revenue ‚Äî seem to be subsidizing the platform for others. That includes apps where Apple doesn‚Äôt take a cut of IAPs.

Still, for the judge to rule for Epic, she would have to find that Apple leveraged its market power as a monopoly. And that means Apple has to actually have a monopoly in the first place. But does it? There are other places to buy apps (Google‚Äôs Android devices, e.g.) and games, like console platforms. Epic wants the definition of a monopoly here narrowed to the market for apps on Apple devices, and that may not work. Though the trial has adjourned, a decision will still be months out, so don‚Äôt worry about prepping your in-app credit card forms and PayPal buttons yet.

The voice actor involved had sued the company saying she never agreed to having her voice recordings appear in the app like this ‚Äî her recordings were only authorized for translations. The new voice TikTok has now added is more upbeat, which doesn‚Äôt work as well in some videos where the point was to use a monotone.

Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, BLK, Chispa, Plenty of Fish and Badoo will be working on these efforts.

Messaging

India‚Äôs government said WhatsApp‚Äôs lawsuit challenging the new local IT ruling was a ‚Äúclear act of defiance.‚Äù WhatsApp says it‚Äôs fighting rules that would allow people‚Äôs private messages to become traceable by the government authorities, and would open the app to mass surveillance.

Cardhop

Flexibits, the company behind the popular productivity app Fantastical, updated its contacts management app Cardhop for Mac and iOS. This second major update to Cardhop brings several new features, including business card scanning, iOS widgets for your favorite Cardhop actions, organizational charts and family trees, and improved integrations with Fantastical. For example, you can now create an event with everyone in a Cardhop group.

Hoptale

Recently launched from public beta, Hoptale is ready to kick off the post-Covid summer travel season with its travel journal and discovery app. The startup uses smart technology to organize trip plans and your photos, and users metadata to create trips as well as ‚Äúhops‚Äù within your trips ‚Äî meaning the individual stops you made during trips at different locations. This creates a travel journal of sorts where you itinerary, points of interest, map and, optionally, your own commentary are organized for you.

You can also share trips publicly with the Hoptale community or privately with friends and family. That could make it easier for sharing your favorite recommendations with someone who wants to know what to do and see from a place you‚Äôve already visited. The beta version had hundreds of users who cataloged thousands of trips, and the app is now open to the wider public.

Poparazzi

Well, you have to see what all the hype is about, right? The new social app for iOS and Android offers Instagram-like photo profiles with one big difference: you can‚Äôt post pictures yourself. Instead, the app only allows users to post photos to their friends‚Äô profiles, arguing against the self-absorbed nature of today‚Äôs social media. After a lot of pre-launch hype on TikTok, the app shot to the top of the App Store at launch where it sits poised to be the viral trendy app of the post-COVID summer.

SpaceX‚Äôs anticipated launch of the Starship SN15 has wrapped up and was largely a success. This was a milestone moment for SpaceX, which has watched past Starship prototypes explode during various states of launch and landing, paving the way for a reusable rocket to Mars. As with past launches, SpaceX broadcast the SN15 event.

The launch took place from SpaceX‚Äôs facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, at 6:24 PM EST. The massive Starship prototype soared several miles into the air before turning off its trio of Raptor engines and making the fall back to Earth. Two engines fired back up to reorient the rocket and bring it safely to the ground.

This marks the first time a Starship prototype has successfully returned from a high-altitude flight to survive touchdown on its landing pad. The video does show a small fire at the base of the rocket, but it was described as ‚Äònot unusual‚Äô because of the type of fuel the rocket was carrying. The team successfully extinguished the fire.

If you missed it the first time around, you can watch the broadcast replay on SpaceX‚Äôs YouTube channel (above). In his own tweet, SpaceX‚Äôs Elon Musk declared, ‚ÄúStarship landing nominal!‚Äù The successful launch comes only a day after the private space company confirmed that it had successfully deployed another 60 of its Starlink Internet satellites.

SpaceX has played a key role in NASA‚Äôs renewed space travel ambitions, particularly its Artemis lunar plans and its work with the International Space Station. Last month, the company received a contract to develop a lunar lander for NASA, which later paused the work after a challenge was submitted by competitor Blue Origin."	https://www.slashgear.com/spacex-starship-sn15-prototype-successfully-lands-with-only-a-small-fire-05671728/	"SpaceX Starship SN15 prototype successfully lands with only a small fireSpaceX‚Äôs anticipated launch of the Starship SN15 has wrapped up and was largely a success.

('pm launches key', 0.6096)	Just 12 hours left to apply to Startup Battlefield at TC Disrupt 2021	"We‚Äôve been urging you to apply to Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 for weeks now, and you have just over 12 hours left before the application window slams shut on May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT). Don‚Äôt procrastinate ‚Äî the experience alone, whether you win the $100,000 prize or not, can improve the trajectory of your business.

Case in point: Mollie Breen started out as a mathematician at the National Security Agency before co-founding an IoT/OT security startup called Perygee. She and her team competed in Startup Battlefield last year at Disrupt 2020. Although they didn‚Äôt reach the finals, Breen has plenty to say about the experience. Here‚Äôs what she shared with us in a quick Q&A.

TC: Why did you apply to Startup Battlefield?

Breen: I admired the leadership and growth of other companies that, at one point, were Startup Battlefield contestants. I noticed they had similar traction to us when they applied, and their products resembled ours in their ability to disrupt the respective industry.

TC: What was the training process like?

Breen: It was incredibly valuable both in the short term and long term. Every team gets a weekly session with the Battlefield editor. Together you rehearse and go over every iteration of the pitch line-by-line and slide-by-slide. After each session, I walked away with constructive feedback on everything ‚Äî the content, the speaking style and even the font color on a particular slide.

This was a unique opportunity, and we put in extra hours to be ahead of schedule, sent drafts for review in the off hours and even doubled down on additional practice with Q&As. As a result, we couldn‚Äôt have been more prepared for pitch day. And the training has stayed with Perygee well past the sessions and the competition.

TC: What did it feel like to pitch at Disrupt?

Breen: Pitching at Disrupt was, in some ways, like other pitches except that you have an international audience. Since, at that point, we had practiced our pitch dozens of times, the real unknown during the competition was the Q&A with the VC judges.

There was additional pressure to answer succinctly and convincingly within a time constraint that you wouldn‚Äôt have during a normal one-on-one pitch. But with the prep help from the TechCrunch team, I felt ready to speak in front of such a large audience. I encourage anyone who might be nervous about the big stage to go for it and trust you‚Äôll have more than enough preparation when you get there.

TC: What was the post-pitch impact? Did you meet investors, press or other key partners?

Breen: It helped accelerate our progress. Following Battlefield, we closed an oversubscribed fundraising round. We acquired additional beta users, including our first beta user who messaged us after reading about Perygee on TechCrunch. We also gained numerous press opportunities to share our story.

It‚Äôs almost a year since Startup Battlefield, and I‚Äôm still impressed by how many people start the conversation saying they watched the pitch while reading our company‚Äôs background. It‚Äôs a reminder that the opportunities created by being a TechCrunch Battlefield company continue.

TC: Do you have any great news to share since your pitch?

Breen: At TechCrunch Battlefield we were a small team doing MVP testing and just about to start raising. Since the pitch, we have scaled on all fronts. We grew the founding team and the engineering team, and we deployed the product to enterprise networks. Some of those deployments include contacts who reached out because of TechCrunch ‚Äî and we raised our seed round!

TC: Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?

Breen: I‚Äôm grateful for the camaraderie and relationships we developed with the other teams. What you didn‚Äôt see on stage during the pitches was all of us cheering one another on from the group chat or social media feed. Even now, we continue to support one another through navigating business questions or promoting product launches. If it weren‚Äôt for Startup Battlefield, I would never have met this awesome group of startups.

('pm launches key', 0.6096)	The CW Renews Agreement With Top Affiliate Nexstar Media Group	"Just in time for the unveiling of its 2021-22 schedule next week, the CW has secured its largest affiliate group for the next season and beyond. The broadcast network and Nexstar Media Group (as well as its operating partners) have reached multi-year agreements to renew CW affiliations in 37 markets across the country (28 Nexstar- and 9 partner-owned television stations), which cover more than 31% of the U.S. audience, serving more than 38 million television households. The deal includes five top-10 market affiliates: WPIX-TV in New York City, KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, KDAF-TV in Dallas, KIAH-TV in Houston, and WDCW-TV in Washington, D.C.

This is the CW‚Äôs first affiliate agreement with Nexstar, which has had CW stations for awhile, since the company in 2019 acquired the previous top CW affiliate group, Tribune, including the flagship stations in New York and Los Angeles. That acquisition happened during Tribune‚Äôs most recent five-year affiliate agreement with the CW, which the new owner fulfilled. In addition to Nexstar, other major station groups whose CW deals are up this year are believed to include Sinclair and Media General.

Related Story The CW Boss On Bringing Alternative & Scripted Programming Back To Saturdays After Long Drought

The CW currently provides its affiliate stations with close to 1,000 hours of programming a year at a relatively inexpensive price point, which was appealing to stations, I hear. The network‚Äôs output went up since the 2019 renewals with Tribune and the other majors as the CW added a new night of original programming on Sunday and has been continually ramping up its original summer slate.

What likely helped seal the renewal was the recent ‚Äútime slot swap‚Äù between the CW and its stations, which are all affiliates as the network does not have owned-and-operated station group behind it. The CW, which reclaimed Sunday night from its affiliates for network programming in 2018, will be expanding to Saturday next season. In exchange of giving the network two hours of primetime on Saturday and Sunday, the stations will be getting back the Monday through Friday 3 PM-4 PM afternoon hour to program to their own needs.

‚ÄúAs the nation‚Äôs largest CW affiliate group, Nexstar is very pleased to extend its longstanding relationship with the network,‚Äù said Tom Carter, Nexstar‚Äôs President, COO and CFO. ‚ÄúThe CW‚Äôs line-up of prime-time entertainment shows, coupled with Nexstar‚Äôs highly-rated local news and other market-centric programming enables us to deliver great content to millions of viewers and exceptional value to our advertisers.‚Äù

The CW‚Äôs digital strategy also reportedly has been key in securing new affiliate agreements. An early adopter of multi-platform viewing, the value of CW‚Äôs growing digital operations on a local level has grown, especially with the new ASTC rules. The CW‚Äôs digital footprint is far more expansive compared to five years ago when the Netflix output deal only allowed for the most recent five episodes of the network‚Äôs shows to be streamed on its digital platforms. Since the CW suppliers Warner Bros. Studios and CBS Studios ended that deal in 2019, the network has had full in-season stacking rights. It has been a big draw for CW fans, with the affiliates able to capitalize on that with local ads they get on those AVOD episodes.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to extend our valued partnership, through a multi-year agreement, with our largest station group, Nexstar. The linear broadcast model remains the backbone of our business model and vitally important as it gives us the scale and local reach that distinguishes us in today‚Äôs marketplace as the original multiplatform network,‚Äù said Betty Ellen Berlamino, EVP, Distribution, The CW. ‚ÄúThe successful launches of our new scripted series Walker, Superman & Lois and Kung Fu, added to our strong programming lineup that includes All American, The Flash, Riverdale, Nancy Drew and Batwoman, combined with the local news and exclusive content produced by Nexstar will continue to deliver high quality viewing for our audience and a first-class advertising platform for our advertisers.‚Äù"	https://deadline.com/2021/05/the-cw-affiliate-agreement-nexstar-media-group-renewed-1234760798/	"Just in time for the unveiling of its 2021-22 schedule next week, the CW has secured its largest affiliate group for the next season and beyond.

You don't need a WoW subscription, just a Battle.net account. The beta will last until around the launch of Burning Crusade Classic, but we don't have an exact timeframe. Probably expect these codes to work for a month or two.

World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic is exactly what it sounds like: a special set of servers that emulate what it was like to play WoW's first expansion when it first launched back in 2007. Burning Crusade Classic is a continuation of the hugely popular WoW Classic servers that launched a few years ago and is included for free in a WoW subscription.

Unlike WoW Classic, though, Blizzard is making some changes based on community feedback. New players will be able to purchase a one-time level boost so they can jump in straight away, and Burning Crusade Classic raid bosses will be based off their original, much more challenging versions since everyone is too good at the game now."	https://www.pcgamer.com/burning-crusade-classic-beta-keys-were-giving-away-300-codes-for-beta-access/	"Original story: World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic launches later this year, but you don't have to wait to venture through the Dark Portal.

Restaurant culture was transformed in 2020.

The World‚Äôs Best Destinations Got Some R&R

During our forced pause, some of the world‚Äôs most overtouristed spots caught a much needed break. Now they‚Äôre showing signs of revitalization, and those who oversee them are rethinking their approach to management. According to a recent World Travel and Tourism Council report, ‚ÄúImprovements in air quality and pollution have been observed [around the world], from blue skies in Kathmandu and clear waterways in Venice to stingrays in Dubai.‚Äù Many countries are investing in tourism infrastructure, among them Iceland, which put $12 billion toward improving its roads, popular tourist sites, and national parks. Raja Ampat, an Indonesian archipelago and diving mecca that had 200 vessels operating in its waters just prior to the pandemic, has put in place new regulations to limit the number of boats, in order to safeguard marine biodiversity. Dubrovnik, Croatia, which received nearly a million cruise-ship passengers in 2019, is taking a similar approach. ‚ÄúThe city saw COVID-19 as an opportunity to implement Global Sustainable Tourism Council destination-management standards, which include limiting day-use visitors during the high season,‚Äù says James Sano, vice president of travel, tourism, and conservation at the World Wildlife Fund. Meanwhile, in a 2020 survey conducted by business development firm Publicis Sapient, 58 percent of respondents said that when it comes to future travel, they are thinking more about the environment and sustainability. ‚ÄîErin Riley

Wildfire Tech Is Hot

The Forest Service has begun using three cutting-edge innovations in California, which had the worst fire season in history last fall, in order to put out fires faster and reduce risk to crews. Lack of visibility has halted efforts in the past, which is why the Air Attack 5-1 is a game changer. The manned craft has infrared technology that can identify hot spots that are otherwise impossible to see. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Predator vision,‚Äù says Bob Baird, the state‚Äôs regional fire director. The Air Attack can fly for 24 hours, enabling pilots to drop water at night instead of waiting until daybreak. It also serves as the firefighting effort‚Äôs in-air coordinator, with a copilot relaying data like the location of power-line hazards to those on the ground. Even newer are UAS drones. (UAS stands for unmanned aerial systems.) These are sent to areas too dangerous for firefighters, where they transmit real-time video that determines how fast a fire is burning and which direction it‚Äôs moving. And to track fires with a greater radius is Fire Watch, a system made possible by high-flying Department of Defense aircraft, advanced satellite systems, and remote sensors. Baird has seen the system track multiple fires spanning more than 220 miles, and it has proved essential when ordering evacuations. ‚ÄîTasha Zemke

We're Adopting More Pets

Outdoor Schools Are Thriving

Since the school year began, my second-grader has attended a free forest school with a small group of kids who roam the woods of a local nature center with a teacher, learning about weather, animals, and more. I wish more children could experience it, and not just during a pandemic. A growing group of advocates and educators think that this might be outdoor schooling‚Äôs moment to finally go mainstream, says Sharon Danks, founder of Green Schoolyards America and coordinator of the collaborative National COVID-19 Outdoor Learning Initiative. While being outside results in a lower risk of virus transmission, outdoor classes also have proven benefits for mental and physical health and a child‚Äôs ability to learn. An increasing number of public schools have signed on to explore outdoor options, Danks says. Since June of 2020, more than 850 people across the country have attended at least one online meeting with Green Schoolyards, and before last fall, the Portland, Maine, public school district built 156 outdoor classroom spaces, with plans to use them year-round. This type of schooling ‚Äúsolves a lot of the dire and urgent problems that people have right now,‚Äù Danks says. But when teachers and students realize how happy they are to be outside, she suspects they won‚Äôt ever want to go back inside. ‚ÄîEmily Sohn

Farmers Are Taking Over Our Roofs

Rooftops have become a prime target for large-scale urban agriculture. In Paris, construction has begun on what promises to be the world‚Äôs largest rooftop farm‚Äîabout the size of two soccer fields. As of early 2021, one-third of the Nature Urbaine organic garden was complete, with another third set to open this spring; the company in charge of the project anticipates growing 20 tons of food. In 2020, Lufa Farms opened up the largest rooftop greenhouse in Montreal. It is the company‚Äôs fourth facility in the city, and Lauren Rathmell, its founder and co-CEO, says it won‚Äôt be the last. Currently, the greenhouses supply approximately 2 percent of Montreal‚Äôs population with fresh vegetables. Rathmell wants to get to the point where she can offer those goods to everyone in the city. She says that would require converting the roofs of 19 shopping centers to grow enough produce for her 1.7 million neighbors. In New York City, Gotham Greens, which launched in 2009, now supplies rooftop-grown produce to 2,000 stores across the U.S. and has facilities in Chicago, Baltimore, Denver, and Providence, Rhode Island. In addition to providing fresh fruit and vegetables to urban communities, reducing the distance food travels also lowers its carbon footprint. Plus, Rathmell says that many rooftops are heat sinks, meaning that they trap the warmth of the sun. Covering roofs with greens keeps the buildings cooler in summer. ‚ÄîA.C. Shilton

The Alt-Meat Revolution Is Upon Us (and It‚Äôs Delicious)

Research in 2017 from the Sentience Institute found that 54 percent of meat-eating Americans would prefer to eat less of it, for either ethical or environmental reasons. By creating a product that‚Äôs reliably similar, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods acknowledged that it‚Äôs OK to like the taste of beef even as you disdain the cruelty imparted by industrial animal agriculture. Venture firms are throwing cash at the category. ‚ÄúIn the first half of 2020, funding of alternative proteins substantially surpassed what the industry raised in all of 2019,‚Äù says Caroline Bushnell, director of corporate engagement for the Good Food Institute, a non¬≠profit that promotes plant-based eating. Fast-food companies are jumping in, too: Burger King unveiled the Impossible Whopper in August, and the McDonald‚Äôs McPlant bur¬≠ger will arrive sometime this year. Meanwhile, Singapore recently be¬≠came the first country to approve the sale of lab-grown meat. ‚ÄîA.C. Shilton

We‚Äôre All Running Now

Thanks to activists like Carolyn Su, the sport is becoming more welcoming

When Carolyn Su discovered the online running community while scrolling on Insta¬≠gram, 16 years after she‚Äôd first laced up her shoes, she was all in. But as the 37-year-old stay-at-home mom devoured content and connected with other runners, she noticed something. In a sport that was supposed to be open to everyone, most people looked the same‚Äîand not like her.

The tipping point came in 2018. Sitting at a running event surrounded by white people, she wondered: If the stories told on panels, in the media, and on social channels were intended to be representative of all runners, why couldn‚Äôt she relate to them?

She felt like an outsider, and not for the first time. As a Taiwanese American growing up in Texas, she experienced a constant pressure to prove she belonged. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dissonance and loneliness that comes from participating in a sport you love but that is blind to the ways it‚Äôs exclusive,‚Äù says Su, who now lives in Massachusetts.

Su knew a more robust, multifaceted running community existed. She‚Äôd seen it when she searched hashtags like #AsianRunners, #BlackRunners, and #NativeWomenRunning. But those voices were all but absent from mainstream media. So she created @diversewerun in 2018 as a central hub to amplify their stories through weekly features on runners. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just for people of color to see ourselves represented, but to broaden the mindset of the majority culture to recognize that there‚Äôs not just one kind of lived experience,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt helps us grow in empathy, too.‚Äù

The account, which now has nearly 11,000 followers, has helped many runners of color process their own experiences. Some of the people profiled have later been picked up by the media, including Su herself, who‚Äôs been featured in Runner‚Äôs World and on podcasts. She has also hosted panels on important ¬≠issues like mental health and safety.

One day she hopes to bring together all kinds of different running crews at a race where, she says, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre able to look around and see: this is DiverseWeRun.‚Äù ‚ÄîChristine Yu

Being Vulnerable Is OK

One of my oldest friends drifted through my hometown early last fall during a merciful lull between waves of the pan¬≠demic. Softened by wine and starry skies, we talked about things we had never opened up about: the depression and anxiety we had been dealing with and the ways we felt unmoored.

She had recently reconnected with some college friends and remarked that they had done the same thing, noting to one another how 2020 had challenged them, and the therapeutic approaches and SSRIs that had helped them through.

‚ÄúThere have been a huge number of conversations throughout COVID-19 about the impact, and one of the silver linings is that it has made people as a community more aware of their mental health,‚Äù says Steven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of Pandemics: Preparing for the Next Global Outbreak of Infectious Disease. If we come away with a greater awareness of our own vulnerability‚Äîand more gentleness toward ourselves and others‚Äîwe will be better for it.

In those few moments when I sat face to face with the people I love in the past year, there was a mutual understanding that none of us were perfectly OK. We were honest about how we were weather¬≠ing the storm and what we needed from one another. Of course, we have always been each other‚Äôs keepers. The hard times simply have a knack for reminding us of that. ‚ÄîAbigail Barronian

The Pebble Mine Is Toast (for Now)

In November, Alaska‚Äôs most controversial extraction project suffered what‚Äôs likely to be a fatal blow. The Trump administration brought the proposal back to life in 2017, and last fall, many expected it to approve the first federal permit needed to develop the mine. But after Donald Trump Jr. came out against it and tapes of the mine project‚Äôs CEO were leaked, the Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit, saying the proposal, which threatens Bristol Bay‚Äôs massive salmon run and the economy that depends on it, did not comply with Clean Water Act guidelines. ‚ÄîLuke Whelan

There‚Äôs a Youth Infusion in Politics

New leaders like Maine‚Äôs Chloe Maxmin will transform the system

In November, when Chloe Maxmin of Maine won a seat in the state senate, she became that body‚Äôs youngest member. She‚Äôd already earned a similar distinction once before. For the previous two years, Maxim, now 28, was the state‚Äôs youngest female representative. Her focus all along? To shift the way politicians talk about climate change.

Maxmin grew up in the small town of ¬≠Nobleboro and got involved with grassroots climate organizing at the age of 12. By the time she graduated from Harvard, she‚Äôd become disillusioned with federal government. ‚ÄúIt felt so hopeless to me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúNo matter how many people protested Keystone XL, Obama still approved it.‚Äù So in 2018, when a state house seat opened up in her district, she jumped at the chance to run.

Maxmin is part of a larger shift in politics. According to the Millennial Action Project, there are 81 millennials in Congress and 1,641 in state legislatures. In the 2020 midterms, Vermont elected its first openly transgender state legislator, 26-year-old Taylor Small.

They‚Äôre coming up with new strategies, too. Instead of campaigning to her Democratic base, Maxmin spent time knocking on doors with Trump signs out front. ‚ÄúIn rural America, where the progressives have really lost power, there are a lot of people who have been left behind, people who have never talked to their rep or senator at the state level,‚Äù she says. Her approach worked.

One year into her tenure as a representative, Maxmin introduced Maine‚Äôs Green New Deal. Among other things, it increased solar requirements for publicly funded building projects, and it mandated that new grid-scale energy projects hire 10 percent of their employees from apprenticeship programs, to support the move away from fossil fuels by facilitating job retraining. ‚ÄúThe idea of the Green New Deal was to draw attention to a different way of talking about climate change, one that‚Äôs rooted in the rural working space,‚Äù she says. The bill passed.

Maxmin and a group of state legislators also worked with the governor to create the Maine Climate Council, a bipartisan group that weighs in on balancing the legislature‚Äôs climate goals with peoples‚Äô needs. Next up? Ensuring that Maine‚Äôs transition to renewable energy benefits everyone, plus more climate bills. ‚ÄúWhat I find exciting,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúis a vision of communities and legislatures across the U.S. passing good policy that shows Congress that there is widespread support for this kind of work.‚Äù ‚ÄîAriella Gintzler

Near Beer Is Hopping

Four years ago, when Jeff Hollander and Paul Pirner hatched the idea for brewing and selling a nonalcoholic craft beer, the two thought it might just be a side hustle. After all, the notion was sparked from being the only two sober people at a party. ‚ÄúWe made 1,000 cases, and they sold out almost immediately,‚Äù says Hollander, who went on to found the Minneapolis-based Hairless Dog Brewing Company with Pirner. Since 2015, sales of nonalcoholic beer have nearly doubled, says Dave Deuser, the CEO of sales and marketing for Radeberger, which produces Clausthaler, a nonalcoholic brand from Germany. In a recent survey from market-research company Mintel, one in ten beer drinkers said they were interested in trying low or nonalcoholic options, suggesting that attitudes around sobriety are changing. Plus, many NA beers taste as good as the real thing. In 2020, Budweiser joined the party, and smaller brewers‚Äîlike Athletic Brewing Company and Hairless Dog‚Äîexpanded their lines. Deuser predicts that in 2021, a store will have five to seven NA selections. We‚Äôll raise a glass to that. ‚ÄîA.C. Shilton

Earth Has a Powerful New Ally

President Biden campaigned on one of the most ambitious climate plans in history and hit the ground running as soon as he got to the Oval Office. Here are five highlights.

1. He rejoined the Paris climate agreement on his first day at the White House, returning the U.S. to the international stage with a more ambitious emissions target than ever before.

2. He‚Äôs appointed a Cabinet of climate hawks. From former New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland heading up the Interior Department and Michael Regan leading the EPA to the climate-¬≠envoy role bestowed on John Kerry and bringing Gina McCarthy back as national climate ¬≠adviser, Biden is putting together a crack team of ¬≠experienced environmental leaders and regulators.

3. He‚Äôs protecting our public lands. Biden paused leases to drill on public lands and waters and has begun working toward permanent conservation of 30 percent of U.S. land by 2030. He got started on that goal by issuing executive actions to begin the process of restoring Bears Ears and Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante National Monuments, and to temporarily halt drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Activists hope the Biden administration will shut down drilling there for good.

4. He‚Äôs restoring environmental regulations. The president has used executive ¬≠orders to look into reinstating emissions standards for cars, to call for new regulations for methane leaks, and to pause offshore drilling. He‚Äôs also thrown out permits for the Keystone XL pipeline and halted expedited reviews of other oil and gas projects.

5. He‚Äôs making our economy carbon-free. Biden campaigned on a $2 trillion plan to overhaul the energy sector through renewables; invest in green transportation like railroads, public transit, and electric cars; and render our infrastructure more energy efficient. By integrating pieces of his plan into tax measures and recovery bills, he hopes to make significant progress. ‚ÄîLuke Whelan

The UnLoneliness Movement Is Just Getting Started

Co-author: Svetlana Isakova

Kotlin Coroutines 1.5.0 is out! Here‚Äôs what the new version brings.

GlobalScope is now marked as a delicate API. GlobalScope is an advanced API that is easy to misuse. The compiler will now warn you about possible misuse and require an opt-in for this class in your program.

Extensions for JUnit. CoroutinesTimeout is now available for JUnit 5.

The refined Channel API. Along with a new naming scheme for the library functions, the non-suspending functions trySend and tryReceive were introduced as better alternatives to offer and poll .

Stabilization of Reactive Integrations. We added more functions for converting from Reactive Streams types to Kotlin Flow and back, stabilized many existing functions and ReactiveContext API.

In this blog post, you will also find recommendations for migrating to the new version.

Start Using Coroutines 1.5.0

GlobalScope marked as a delicate API

The GlobalScope class is now marked with the @DelicateCoroutinesApi annotation. From now on, any use of GlobalScope requires an explicit opt-in with @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) .

While the use of GlobalScope isn‚Äôt recommended for most cases, the official documentation still introduces the concepts via this delicate API.

A global CoroutineScope is not bound to any job. Global scope is used to launch top-level coroutines that operate during the whole application lifetime and are not canceled prematurely. Active coroutines launched in GlobalScope do not keep the process alive. They are like daemon threads.

This is a delicate API and it is easy to accidentally create resource or memory leaks when GlobalScope is used. A coroutine launched in GlobalScope is not subject to the principle of structured concurrency, so if it hangs or gets delayed due to a problem (e.g. due to a slow network), it will keep working and consuming resources. For example, consider the following code:

fun loadConfiguration() { GlobalScope.launch { val config = fetchConfigFromServer() // network request updateConfiguration(config) } }

A call to loadConfiguration creates a coroutine in GlobalScope that works in the background without any provision to cancel it or to wait for its completion. If the network is slow, it keeps waiting in the background, consuming resources. Repeated calls to loadConfiguration will consume more and more resources.

Possible replacements

In many cases, the use of GlobalScope should be avoided and the containing operation should be marked with suspend , for example:

suspend fun loadConfiguration() { val config = fetchConfigFromServer() // network request updateConfiguration(config) }

In cases when GlobalScope.launch is used to launch multiple concurrent operations, the corresponding operations should be grouped with coroutineScope instead:

// concurrently load configuration and data suspend fun loadConfigurationAndData() { coroutineScope { launch { loadConfiguration() } launch { loadData() } } }

In top-level code, when launching a concurrent operation from a non-suspending context, an appropriately confined instance of CoroutineScope should be used instead of GlobalScope .

Legitimate use cases

There are limited circumstances under which GlobalScope can be legitimately and safely used, such as top-level background processes that must stay active for the whole duration of an application‚Äôs lifetime. Because of that, any use of GlobalScope requires an explicit opt-in with @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) , like this:

// A global coroutine to log statistics every second, // must be always active @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) val globalScopeReporter = GlobalScope.launch { while (true) { delay(1000) logStatistics() } }

We recommend reviewing all your usages of GlobalScope carefully and annotating only those that fall under the ‚Äúlegitimate use-cases‚Äù category. For any other usages, they could likely be a source of bugs in your code ‚Äì replace such GlobalScope usages as described above.

Extensions for JUnit 5

We have added a CoroutinesTimeout annotation that allows running tests in a separate thread, failing them after the provided time limit and interrupting the thread. Previously, CoroutinesTimeout was available for JUnit 4. In this release, we‚Äôre adding the integration for JUnit 5.

To use the new annotation, add the following dependency to your project:

dependencies { ‚Ä¶ testImplementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-debug:$coroutinesVersion"") }

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the new CoroutinesTimeout in your tests:

import kotlinx.coroutines.debug.junit5.CoroutinesTimeout import kotlinx.coroutines.delay import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking import org.junit.Test @CoroutinesTimeout(100) class CoroutinesTimeoutSimpleTest { @CoroutinesTimeout(300) @Test fun firstTest() { runBlocking { delay(200) // succeeds } } @Test fun secondTest() { runBlocking { delay(200) // fails } } }

In the example, the coroutines timeout is defined at a class level and specifically for the firstTest . The annotated test does not timeout, as the annotation on the function overrides the class-level one. The secondTest uses the class-level annotation, so it times out.

The annotation is declared in the following way:

package kotlinx.coroutines.debug.junit5 public annotation class CoroutinesTimeout( val testTimeoutMs: Long, val cancelOnTimeout: Boolean = false )

The first parameter, testTimeoutMs , specifies the timeout duration in milliseconds. The second parameter, cancelOnTimeout , determines if all the running coroutines should be canceled at the moment of the timeout. If it‚Äôs set to true , all the coroutines will be automatically canceled.

Whenever you use the CoroutinesTimeout annotation, it automatically enables the coroutines debugger and dumps all coroutines at the moment of the timeout. The dump contains the coroutine creation stack traces. If there is a need to disable the creation stack traces in order to speed tests up, consider directly using CoroutinesTimeoutExtension , which allows this configuration.

Many thanks to Abhijit Sarkar, who created a useful PoC for CoroutinesTimeout for JUnit 5. The idea was developed into the new CoroutinesTimeout annotation that we added in the 1.5 release.

Channel API refinement

Channels are important communication primitives that allow you to pass data between different coroutines and callbacks. In this release, we reworked the Channel API a bit, replacing the offer and poll functions causing confusion with better alternatives. Along the way, we developed a new consistent naming scheme for suspending and non-suspending methods.

The new naming scheme

We tried to work towards a consistent naming scheme to use further in other libraries or Coroutines API. We wanted to make sure that the name of the function would convey the information about its behavior. As a result, we came up with the following:

The regular suspending methods are left as-is, e.g., send , receive .

, . Their non-suspending counterparts with error encapsulation are consistently prefixed with ‚Äútry‚Äù: trySend and tryReceive instead of the old offer and poll .

and instead of the old and . New error-encapsulating suspending methods will have the suffix ‚ÄúCatching‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details about these new methods.

Try functions: non-suspending counterparts to send and receive

One coroutine can send some information to a channel, while the other one can receive this information from it. Both send and receive functions are suspending. send suspends its coroutine if the channel is full and can‚Äôt take a new element, while receive suspends its coroutine if the channel has no elements to return:

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { // Suspends until the element can be sent println(""Sending..."") channel.send(""Element"") } // Suspends until the element can be received println(""Receiving..."") println(channel.receive()) }

These functions have non-suspending counterparts for use in synchronous code: offer and poll , which are now deprecated in favor of trySend and tryReceive . Let‚Äôs discuss the reasons for this change.

offer and poll are supposed to do the same thing as send and receive , but without suspension. It sounds easy, and everything works fine when the element can be sent or received. But in case of an error, what happens? send and receive would suspend until they can do their job. offer and poll simply returned false and null , respectively, if the element couldn‚Äôt be added because the channel is full, or no element can be retrieved because the channel is empty. They both threw an exception in an attempt to work with a closed channel, and this last detail turned out to be confusing.

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { println(""Sending..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'false' if the channel is full // Or throws an exception if it's closed channel.offer(""Element"") } println(""Receiving..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'null' if the channel is empty println(channel.poll()) // channel.close() }

In this example, poll is called before any element is added and therefore returns null immediately. Note that it‚Äôs not supposed to be used in this way: you should instead continue polling elements regularly, but we call it directly for simplicity of this explanation. The invocation of offer is also unsuccessful since our channel is a rendezvous channel and has zero buffer capacity. As a result, offer returns false , and poll returns null , simply because they were called in the wrong order.

In the example above, try uncommenting the channel.close() statement to make sure that the exception is thrown. In this case, poll returns false , as before. But then offer tries to add an element to an already closed channel, fails, and throws an exception. We received many complaints that such behavior is error-prone. It‚Äôs easy to forget to catch this exception, and while you‚Äôd rather ignore it or handle it differently, it crashes your program.

The new trySend and tryReceive fix this issue and return a more detailed result. Each returns the ChannelResult instance, which is one of the three things: a successful result, a failure, or an indication that the channel was closed.

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { println(""Sending..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'Failed' if the channel is full // Or 'Channel was closed' result if it's closed val result = channel.trySend(""Element"") println(result) //We can verify the result if(result.isClosed){ println(""Sending failed. The channel is closed."") } } println(""Receiving..."") println(channel.tryReceive()) // channel.close() }

This example works in the same way as the previous one, with the only difference that tryReceive and trySend return a more detailed result. You can see Value(Failed) in the output instead of false and null . Uncomment the line closing the channel again and ensure that trySend now returns Closed result capturing an exception.

Thanks to inline value classes, using ChannelResult doesn‚Äôt create additional wrappers underneath, and if the successful value is returned, it‚Äôs returned as is, without any overhead.

Catching functions: suspending functions that encapsulate errors

Starting from this release, the error-encapsulating suspending methods will have the suffix ‚ÄúCatching‚Äù. For instance, the new receiveCatching function handles the exception in the case of a closed channel. Consider this simple example:

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() channel.close() println(channel.receiveCatching()) }

The channel is closed before we try retrieving a value. However, the program completes successfully, indicating that the channel was closed. If you replace receiveCatching with the ordinary receive function, it will throw ClosedReceiveChannelException :

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() channel.close() println(channel.receive()) }

For now, we only provide receiveCatching and onReceiveCatching (instead of the previously internal receiveOrClosed ), but we have plans to add more functions.

Migrating your code to new functions

You can replace all the usages of the offer and poll functions in your project automatically with new calls. Since offer returned Boolean , its equivalent replacement is channel.trySend(""Element"").isSuccess .

Likewise, the poll function returns a nullable element, so its replacement becomes channel.tryReceive().getOrNull() .

If the result of the invocation wasn‚Äôt used, you can replace them directly with new calls.

The behavior towards handling exceptions is now different, so you will need to make the necessary updates manually. If your code relies on ‚Äòoffer‚Äô and ‚Äòpoll‚Äô methods throwing exceptions on a closed channel, you‚Äôll need to use the following replacements.

The equivalent replacement for channel.offer(""Element"") should throw an exception if the channel was closed, even if it was closed normally:

channel .trySend(""Element"") .onClosed { throw it ?: ClosedSendChannelException(""Channel was closed"") } .isSuccess

The equivalent replacement for channel.poll() throws an exception if the channel was closed with an error and returns null if it was closed normally:

channel.tryReceive() .onClosed { if (it != null) throw it } .getOrNull()

Such changes reflect the old behavior of offer and poll functions.

We assume that in most cases, your code didn‚Äôt rely on these subtleties of behavior on a closed channel, but rather that it was a source of bugs. That‚Äôs why the automatic replacements provided by IDE simplify the semantics. If this is not true for you, please review and update your usages manually and consider rewriting them completely to handle the cases of closed channels differently, without throwing exceptions.

Reactive integrations on the road to stability

Version 1.5 of Kotlin Coroutines promotes most of the functions responsible for integrations with reactive frameworks to stable API.

In the JVM ecosystem, there are a few frameworks that deal with asynchronous stream processing conforming to the Reactive Streams standard. For instance, Project Reactor and RxJava are the two popular Java frameworks in this area.

While Kotlin Flows are different and the types are not compatible with the ones specified by the standard, they are conceptually still streams. It is possible to convert Flow to the reactive (specification and TCK compliant) Publisher and vice versa. Such converters are provided by kotlinx.coroutines out-of-the-box and can be found in the corresponding reactive modules.

For instance, if you need interoperability with the Project Reactor types, you should add the following dependencies to your project:

dependencies { implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:${coroutinesVersion}"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor:${coroutinesVersion}"") }

Then you will be able to use Flow<T>.asPublisher() if you want to use the Reactive Streams types, or Flow<T>.asFlux() if you need to use Project Reactor types directly.

// acquire a Flow instance val flow: Flow<event> = flow { ‚Ä¶ } // Convert Flow to Publisher val publisher = flow.asPublisher() // Convert Flow to Reactor's Flux val flux = flow.asFlux() //Convert back to Flow val anotherFlow = flux.asFlow()

This is a very condensed view of the subject at hand. If you are interested in learning more, consider reading Roman Elizarov‚Äôs article about Reactive Streams and Kotlin Flows.

While the integrations with reactive libraries are working towards the stabilization of the API, technically, the goal is to get rid of the @ExperimentalCoroutinesApi and implement the leftovers for various topics.

Improved integration with Reactive Streams

Compatibility with Reactive Streams specifications is important in order to ensure interoperability between 3rd-party frameworks and Kotlin Coroutines. It helps to adopt Kotlin Coroutines in legacy projects without the need to rewrite all of the code.

There is a long list of functions that we managed to promote to stable status this time. It is now possible to convert a type from any Reactive Streams implementation to Flow and back. For instance, the new code can be written with Coroutines, but integrated with the old reactive codebase via the opposite converters:

fun legacyFunThatHaveToReturnObservable(): Observable<int> { return flow<int> { // Use the power of flow! } // various flow operations .asObservable() }

Also, numerous improvements were made to ReactorContext , which wraps Reactor‚Äôs Context into CoroutineContext for seamless integration between Project Reactor and Kotlin Coroutines. With this integration, it is possible to propagate the information about Reactor‚Äôs Context through coroutines.

The context is implicitly propagated through the subscribers‚Äô context by all Reactive integrations, such as Mono , Flux , Publisher.asFlow , Flow.asPublisher and Flow.asFlux . Here‚Äôs a simple example of propagating the subscriber‚Äôs Context to ReactorContext :

import kotlinx.coroutines.currentCoroutineContext import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.flow import kotlinx.coroutines.reactor.ReactorContext import kotlinx.coroutines.reactor.asFlux fun main() { val flow = flow<int> { println(""Reactor context in Flow: "" + currentCoroutineContext()[ReactorContext]?.context) } // No context // prints ""Reactor context in Flow: null"" flow.asFlux().subscribe() // Add subscriber's context // prints ""Reactor context in Flow: Context1{answer=42}"" flow.asFlux() .contextWrite { ctx -> ctx.put(""answer"", 42) } .subscribe() }

In the example above, we construct a Flow instance which is then converted to Reactor‚Äôs Flux instance, with no context. The effect of calling the subscribe() method without an argument is to request the publisher to send all data. As a result, the program prints the phrase ‚ÄúReactor context in Flow: null‚Äù.

The next call chain also converts the Flow to Flux , but then adds a key-value pair, answer=42, to the Reactor‚Äôs context for this chain. The call to subscribe() triggers the chain. In this case, since the context is populated, the program prints ‚ÄúReactor context in Flow: Context1{answer=42}‚Äù

New convenience functions

When working with reactive types like Mono in the Coroutines context, there are a few convenience functions that allow retrieval without blocking the thread. In this release, we deprecated awaitSingleOr* functions on arbitrary Publisher s, and specialized some await* functions for Mono and Maybe .

Mono produces at most one value, so the last element is the same as the first. In this case, the semantics of dropping the remaining elements isn‚Äôt useful as well. Therefore, Mono.awaitFirst() and Mono.awaitLast() are deprecated in favour of Mono.awaitSingle() .

Start using kotlinx.coroutines 1.5.0!

The new release features an impressive list of changes. The new naming scheme developed while refining the Channels API is a notable achievement by the team. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a great focus on making the Coroutines API as simple and intuitive as possible.

To start using the new version of Kotlin Coroutines, just update the content of your build.gradle.kts file. First, make sure that you have the latest version of the Kotlin Gradle plugin:

plugins { kotlin(""jvm"") version ""1.5.0"" }

And then update the versions of the dependencies, including the libraries with specific integrations for the Reactive Streams.

val coroutinesVersion = ""1.5.0"" dependencies { implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactive:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-rx3:$coroutinesVersion"") ... }

Kotlin Coroutines 1.5.0 is out! Here‚Äôs what the new version brings.

GlobalScope is now marked as a delicate API. GlobalScope is an advanced API that is easy to misuse. The compiler will now warn you about possible misuse and require an opt-in for this class in your program.

Extensions for JUnit. CoroutinesTimeout is now available for JUnit 5.

The refined Channel API. Along with a new naming scheme for the library functions, the non-suspending functions trySend and tryReceive were introduced as better alternatives to offer and poll .

Stabilization of Reactive Integrations. We added more functions for converting from Reactive Streams types to Kotlin Flow and back, stabilized many existing functions and ReactiveContext API.

In this blog post, you will also find recommendations for migrating to the new version.

Start Using Coroutines 1.5.0

GlobalScope marked as a delicate API

The GlobalScope class is now marked with the @DelicateCoroutinesApi annotation. From now on, any use of GlobalScope requires an explicit opt-in with @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) .

While the use of GlobalScope isn‚Äôt recommended for most cases, the official documentation still introduces the concepts via this delicate API.

A global CoroutineScope is not bound to any job. Global scope is used to launch top-level coroutines that operate during the whole application lifetime and are not canceled prematurely. Active coroutines launched in GlobalScope do not keep the process alive. They are like daemon threads.

This is a delicate API and it is easy to accidentally create resource or memory leaks when GlobalScope is used. A coroutine launched in GlobalScope is not subject to the principle of structured concurrency, so if it hangs or gets delayed due to a problem (e.g. due to a slow network), it will keep working and consuming resources. For example, consider the following code:

fun loadConfiguration() { GlobalScope.launch { val config = fetchConfigFromServer() // network request updateConfiguration(config) } }

A call to loadConfiguration creates a coroutine in GlobalScope that works in the background without any provision to cancel it or to wait for its completion. If the network is slow, it keeps waiting in the background, consuming resources. Repeated calls to loadConfiguration will consume more and more resources.

Possible replacements

In many cases, the use of GlobalScope should be avoided and the containing operation should be marked with suspend , for example:

suspend fun loadConfiguration() { val config = fetchConfigFromServer() // network request updateConfiguration(config) }

In cases when GlobalScope.launch is used to launch multiple concurrent operations, the corresponding operations should be grouped with coroutineScope instead:

// concurrently load configuration and data suspend fun loadConfigurationAndData() { coroutineScope { launch { loadConfiguration() } launch { loadData() } } }

In top-level code, when launching a concurrent operation from a non-suspending context, an appropriately confined instance of CoroutineScope should be used instead of GlobalScope .

Legitimate use cases

There are limited circumstances under which GlobalScope can be legitimately and safely used, such as top-level background processes that must stay active for the whole duration of an application‚Äôs lifetime. Because of that, any use of GlobalScope requires an explicit opt-in with @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) , like this:

// A global coroutine to log statistics every second, // must be always active @OptIn(DelicateCoroutinesApi::class) val globalScopeReporter = GlobalScope.launch { while (true) { delay(1000) logStatistics() } }

We recommend reviewing all your usages of GlobalScope carefully and annotating only those that fall under the ‚Äúlegitimate use-cases‚Äù category. For any other usages, they could likely be a source of bugs in your code ‚Äì replace such GlobalScope usages as described above.

Extensions for JUnit 5

We have added a CoroutinesTimeout annotation that allows running tests in a separate thread, failing them after the provided time limit and interrupting the thread. Previously, CoroutinesTimeout was available for JUnit 4. In this release, we‚Äôre adding the integration for JUnit 5.

To use the new annotation, add the following dependency to your project:

dependencies { ‚Ä¶ testImplementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-debug:$coroutinesVersion"") }

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the new CoroutinesTimeout in your tests:

import kotlinx.coroutines.debug.junit5.CoroutinesTimeout import kotlinx.coroutines.delay import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking import org.junit.Test @CoroutinesTimeout(100) class CoroutinesTimeoutSimpleTest { @CoroutinesTimeout(300) @Test fun firstTest() { runBlocking { delay(200) // succeeds } } @Test fun secondTest() { runBlocking { delay(200) // fails } } }

In the example, the coroutines timeout is defined at a class level and specifically for the firstTest . The annotated test does not timeout, as the annotation on the function overrides the class-level one. The secondTest uses the class-level annotation, so it times out.

The annotation is declared in the following way:

package kotlinx.coroutines.debug.junit5 public annotation class CoroutinesTimeout( val testTimeoutMs: Long, val cancelOnTimeout: Boolean = false )

The first parameter, testTimeoutMs , specifies the timeout duration in milliseconds. The second parameter, cancelOnTimeout , determines if all the running coroutines should be canceled at the moment of the timeout. If it‚Äôs set to true , all the coroutines will be automatically canceled.

Whenever you use the CoroutinesTimeout annotation, it automatically enables the coroutines debugger and dumps all coroutines at the moment of the timeout. The dump contains the coroutine creation stack traces. If there is a need to disable the creation stack traces in order to speed tests up, consider directly using CoroutinesTimeoutExtension , which allows this configuration.

Many thanks to Abhijit Sarkar, who created a useful PoC for CoroutinesTimeout for JUnit 5. The idea was developed into the new CoroutinesTimeout annotation that we added in the 1.5 release.

Channel API refinement

Channels are important communication primitives that allow you to pass data between different coroutines and callbacks. In this release, we reworked the Channel API a bit, replacing the offer and poll functions causing confusion with better alternatives. Along the way, we developed a new consistent naming scheme for suspending and non-suspending methods.

The new naming scheme

We tried to work towards a consistent naming scheme to use further in other libraries or Coroutines API. We wanted to make sure that the name of the function would convey the information about its behavior. As a result, we came up with the following:

The regular suspending methods are left as-is, e.g., send , receive .

, . Their non-suspending counterparts with error encapsulation are consistently prefixed with ‚Äútry‚Äù: trySend and tryReceive instead of the old offer and poll .

and instead of the old and . New error-encapsulating suspending methods will have the suffix ‚ÄúCatching‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs dive into the details about these new methods.

Try functions: non-suspending counterparts to send and receive

One coroutine can send some information to a channel, while the other one can receive this information from it. Both send and receive functions are suspending. send suspends its coroutine if the channel is full and can‚Äôt take a new element, while receive suspends its coroutine if the channel has no elements to return:

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { // Suspends until the element can be sent println(""Sending..."") channel.send(""Element"") } // Suspends until the element can be received println(""Receiving..."") println(channel.receive()) }

These functions have non-suspending counterparts for use in synchronous code: offer and poll , which are now deprecated in favor of trySend and tryReceive . Let‚Äôs discuss the reasons for this change.

offer and poll are supposed to do the same thing as send and receive , but without suspension. It sounds easy, and everything works fine when the element can be sent or received. But in case of an error, what happens? send and receive would suspend until they can do their job. offer and poll simply returned false and null , respectively, if the element couldn‚Äôt be added because the channel is full, or no element can be retrieved because the channel is empty. They both threw an exception in an attempt to work with a closed channel, and this last detail turned out to be confusing.

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { println(""Sending..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'false' if the channel is full // Or throws an exception if it's closed channel.offer(""Element"") } println(""Receiving..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'null' if the channel is empty println(channel.poll()) // channel.close() }

In this example, poll is called before any element is added and therefore returns null immediately. Note that it‚Äôs not supposed to be used in this way: you should instead continue polling elements regularly, but we call it directly for simplicity of this explanation. The invocation of offer is also unsuccessful since our channel is a rendezvous channel and has zero buffer capacity. As a result, offer returns false , and poll returns null , simply because they were called in the wrong order.

In the example above, try uncommenting the channel.close() statement to make sure that the exception is thrown. In this case, poll returns false , as before. But then offer tries to add an element to an already closed channel, fails, and throws an exception. We received many complaints that such behavior is error-prone. It‚Äôs easy to forget to catch this exception, and while you‚Äôd rather ignore it or handle it differently, it crashes your program.

The new trySend and tryReceive fix this issue and return a more detailed result. Each returns the ChannelResult instance, which is one of the three things: a successful result, a failure, or an indication that the channel was closed.

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() launch { println(""Sending..."") // Doesn't suspend // Returns 'Failed' if the channel is full // Or 'Channel was closed' result if it's closed val result = channel.trySend(""Element"") println(result) //We can verify the result if(result.isClosed){ println(""Sending failed. The channel is closed."") } } println(""Receiving..."") println(channel.tryReceive()) // channel.close() }

This example works in the same way as the previous one, with the only difference that tryReceive and trySend return a more detailed result. You can see Value(Failed) in the output instead of false and null . Uncomment the line closing the channel again and ensure that trySend now returns Closed result capturing an exception.

Thanks to inline value classes, using ChannelResult doesn‚Äôt create additional wrappers underneath, and if the successful value is returned, it‚Äôs returned as is, without any overhead.

Catching functions: suspending functions that encapsulate errors

Starting from this release, the error-encapsulating suspending methods will have the suffix ‚ÄúCatching‚Äù. For instance, the new receiveCatching function handles the exception in the case of a closed channel. Consider this simple example:

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() channel.close() println(channel.receiveCatching()) }

The channel is closed before we try retrieving a value. However, the program completes successfully, indicating that the channel was closed. If you replace receiveCatching with the ordinary receive function, it will throw ClosedReceiveChannelException :

import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel import kotlinx.coroutines.launch import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { val channel = Channel<String>() channel.close() println(channel.receive()) }

For now, we only provide receiveCatching and onReceiveCatching (instead of the previously internal receiveOrClosed ), but we have plans to add more functions.

Migrating your code to new functions

You can replace all the usages of the offer and poll functions in your project automatically with new calls. Since offer returned Boolean , its equivalent replacement is channel.trySend(""Element"").isSuccess .

Likewise, the poll function returns a nullable element, so its replacement becomes channel.tryReceive().getOrNull() .

If the result of the invocation wasn‚Äôt used, you can replace them directly with new calls.

The behavior towards handling exceptions is now different, so you will need to make the necessary updates manually. If your code relies on ‚Äòoffer‚Äô and ‚Äòpoll‚Äô methods throwing exceptions on a closed channel, you‚Äôll need to use the following replacements.

The equivalent replacement for channel.offer(""Element"") should throw an exception if the channel was closed, even if it was closed normally:

channel .trySend(""Element"") .onClosed { throw it ?: ClosedSendChannelException(""Channel was closed"") } .isSuccess

The equivalent replacement for channel.poll() throws an exception if the channel was closed with an error and returns null if it was closed normally:

channel.tryReceive() .onClosed { if (it != null) throw it } .getOrNull()

Such changes reflect the old behavior of offer and poll functions.

We assume that in most cases, your code didn‚Äôt rely on these subtleties of behavior on a closed channel, but rather that it was a source of bugs. That‚Äôs why the automatic replacements provided by IDE simplify the semantics. If this is not true for you, please review and update your usages manually and consider rewriting them completely to handle the cases of closed channels differently, without throwing exceptions.

Reactive integrations on the road to stability

Version 1.5 of Kotlin Coroutines promotes most of the functions responsible for integrations with reactive frameworks to stable API.

In the JVM ecosystem, there are a few frameworks that deal with asynchronous stream processing conforming to the Reactive Streams standard. For instance, Project Reactor and RxJava are the two popular Java frameworks in this area.

While Kotlin Flows are different and the types are not compatible with the ones specified by the standard, they are conceptually still streams. It is possible to convert Flow to the reactive (specification and TCK compliant) Publisher and vice versa. Such converters are provided by kotlinx.coroutines out-of-the-box and can be found in the corresponding reactive modules.

For instance, if you need interoperability with the Project Reactor types, you should add the following dependencies to your project:

dependencies { implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:${coroutinesVersion}"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor:${coroutinesVersion}"") }

Then you will be able to use Flow<T>.asPublisher() if you want to use the Reactive Streams types, or Flow<T>.asFlux() if you need to use Project Reactor types directly.

// acquire a Flow instance val flow: Flow<event> = flow { ‚Ä¶ } // Convert Flow to Publisher val publisher = flow.asPublisher() // Convert Flow to Reactor's Flux val flux = flow.asFlux() //Convert back to Flow val anotherFlow = flux.asFlow()

This is a very condensed view of the subject at hand. If you are interested in learning more, consider reading Roman Elizarov‚Äôs article about Reactive Streams and Kotlin Flows.

While the integrations with reactive libraries are working towards the stabilization of the API, technically, the goal is to get rid of the @ExperimentalCoroutinesApi and implement the leftovers for various topics.

Improved integration with Reactive Streams

Compatibility with Reactive Streams specifications is important in order to ensure interoperability between 3rd-party frameworks and Kotlin Coroutines. It helps to adopt Kotlin Coroutines in legacy projects without the need to rewrite all of the code.

There is a long list of functions that we managed to promote to stable status this time. It is now possible to convert a type from any Reactive Streams implementation to Flow and back. For instance, the new code can be written with Coroutines, but integrated with the old reactive codebase via the opposite converters:

fun legacyFunThatHaveToReturnObservable(): Observable<int> { return flow<int> { // Use the power of flow! } // various flow operations .asObservable() }

Also, numerous improvements were made to ReactorContext , which wraps Reactor‚Äôs Context into CoroutineContext for seamless integration between Project Reactor and Kotlin Coroutines. With this integration, it is possible to propagate the information about Reactor‚Äôs Context through coroutines.

The context is implicitly propagated through the subscribers‚Äô context by all Reactive integrations, such as Mono , Flux , Publisher.asFlow , Flow.asPublisher and Flow.asFlux . Here‚Äôs a simple example of propagating the subscriber‚Äôs Context to ReactorContext :

import kotlinx.coroutines.currentCoroutineContext import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.flow import kotlinx.coroutines.reactor.ReactorContext import kotlinx.coroutines.reactor.asFlux fun main() { val flow = flow<int> { println(""Reactor context in Flow: "" + currentCoroutineContext()[ReactorContext]?.context) } // No context // prints ""Reactor context in Flow: null"" flow.asFlux().subscribe() // Add subscriber's context // prints ""Reactor context in Flow: Context1{answer=42}"" flow.asFlux() .contextWrite { ctx -> ctx.put(""answer"", 42) } .subscribe() }

In the example above, we construct a Flow instance which is then converted to Reactor‚Äôs Flux instance, with no context. The effect of calling the subscribe() method without an argument is to request the publisher to send all data. As a result, the program prints the phrase ‚ÄúReactor context in Flow: null‚Äù.

The next call chain also converts the Flow to Flux , but then adds a key-value pair, answer=42, to the Reactor‚Äôs context for this chain. The call to subscribe() triggers the chain. In this case, since the context is populated, the program prints ‚ÄúReactor context in Flow: Context1{answer=42}‚Äù

New convenience functions

When working with reactive types like Mono in the Coroutines context, there are a few convenience functions that allow retrieval without blocking the thread. In this release, we deprecated awaitSingleOr* functions on arbitrary Publisher s, and specialized some await* functions for Mono and Maybe .

Mono produces at most one value, so the last element is the same as the first. In this case, the semantics of dropping the remaining elements isn‚Äôt useful as well. Therefore, Mono.awaitFirst() and Mono.awaitLast() are deprecated in favour of Mono.awaitSingle() .

Start using kotlinx.coroutines 1.5.0!

The new release features an impressive list of changes. The new naming scheme developed while refining the Channels API is a notable achievement by the team. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a great focus on making the Coroutines API as simple and intuitive as possible.

To start using the new version of Kotlin Coroutines, just update the content of your build.gradle.kts file. First, make sure that you have the latest version of the Kotlin Gradle plugin:

plugins { kotlin(""jvm"") version ""1.5.0"" }

And then update the versions of the dependencies, including the libraries with specific integrations for the Reactive Streams.

val coroutinesVersion = ""1.5.0"" dependencies { implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactive:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-reactor:$coroutinesVersion"") implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-rx3:$coroutinesVersion"") ... }

('projects poll bound', 0.4893)	Virginia Republicans‚Äô messy, Trumpy race to select a nominee for governor	"GALAX, Virginia ‚Äî Republican gubernatorial candidate Kirk Cox was several minutes into a wonky election security answer at a diner when January 6 came up again.

Did President Joe Biden win the election? Cox avoided directly answering the question at this recent event, though he had previously acknowledged that reality, the one GOP frontrunner willing to do so.

Instead, he refocused on proposals like voter ID requirements, which are popular with lots of voters. But now, Lin, a Trump supporter who had posed the Biden question, had another one. She wanted to know whether he agreed with the Virginia Senate censuring one of its members, Amanda Chase, after she called the people who stormed the US Capitol that day in January ‚Äúpatriots.‚Äù

Did Cox support the ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù of Chase, now one of Cox‚Äôs competitors for the Republican nomination?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very much for freedom of speech,‚Äù Cox answered.

‚ÄúSo you were against [the censure vote]?‚Äù asked Lin, who supports Chase in the race. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put words in your mouth, but I need a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or a ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù

This narrow line on the 2020 election and cancel culture is one Republicans have had to dance along for months in courting voters before Saturday‚Äôs Virginia GOP gubernatorial convention.

The GOP has had a tough go of it statewide in the past few years in Virginia, with demographic changes helping push the state to become reliably Democratic. The party‚Äôs response ‚Äî running further and further to the right ‚Äî has only exacerbated the problem. But Virginia might not be lost to the right kind of Republican. At least not yet.

Republicans will choose their nominee in an ‚Äúunassembled convention‚Äù; nearly 54,000 Republicans who successfully applied to be a delegate will be able to cast ranked-choice ballots at 39 drive-up locations around Virginia. It‚Äôs a process that has had more than a few bumps along the way, including Chase alleging the party chose a convention over a primary to prevent her from becoming the nominee. It could also take several days to know the results ‚Äî candidates have already sown doubt about the race.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to make the Iowa caucuses look like a well-oiled machine,‚Äù a Democratic operative said, with a touch of hopeful glee.

The candidates represent a few ways the GOP could go in Virginia

Virginia last chose a Republican in a statewide election in 2009. Since then, the GOP has run candidates that its own insiders say don‚Äôt appeal to the state‚Äôs growing suburban population. They‚Äôre going to have to make inroads back into those communities to have a hope of winning, says Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato‚Äôs Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics.

‚ÄúI always look at, in the 2016 primaries, places where candidates like John Kasich and Marco Rubio did well against Trump: Those are the areas that have moved more toward the Democrats since ‚Äî places like Loudoun County, Hanover County, Chesterfield County,‚Äù Coleman said. ‚ÄúMaybe those voters are still open to the right type of Republican after voting for Hillary [Clinton] and Biden.‚Äù

But can they do that while turning out the 44 percent of the state that went for Trump?

The mix of contenders has been revealing.

Chase, the self-described ‚ÄúTrump in heels,‚Äù has dominated headlines in national media, saying things like the Derek Chauvin verdict made her ‚Äúsick‚Äù because she worried about how cops would feel about it. And she‚Äôs popular with the base, at least according to a February poll and a more recent one conducted by Democrats.

Businessman and former lieutenant governor hopeful Pete Snyder is nearly as Trumpy, railing against the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù liberal establishment and highlighting endorsements from figures like Ken Cuccinelli and Sheriff David Clarke.

Meanwhile, newcomer and former private equity group executive Glenn Youngkin has surged to the top of some recent straw polls by running a well-funded campaign that ticks all the conservative culture war boxes but also talks about appealing to ‚ÄúTrump Republicans, libertarians, and Democrats‚Äù to win in November.

Cox, a delegate in the Virginia House and formerly the body‚Äôs speaker, remains the establishment favorite. He touts his know-how on implementing conservative policies, telling Vox, ‚Äúit‚Äôs very important to have the experience to know how to run the state and to make good decisions.‚Äù

But regardless of how candidates are positioning themselves, there are certain issues that keep coming up on the trail: support for law enforcement, the eradication of ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù from schools, and election integrity, to name a few.

And for some voters, like Heather, who attended Cox‚Äôs event in Galax, the last on that list is most important ‚Äî or, more specifically, it‚Äôs the question of whether Joe Biden won the 2020 election that matters most.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs first and foremost for this election or any election.‚Äù

Virginia Republicans want to stay competitive ‚Äî and keep conservatives on board

The future of the GOP after Trump is an open question. And barring disputes like the one playing out between US Rep. Liz Cheney and the bulk of the House GOP right now, Virginia might be the best glimpse we get before the 2022 midterms.

Here‚Äôs what it looks like: There are seven candidates running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, with four in real contention (Youngkin, Chase, Cox, and Snyder). All of them tout their traditional conservative bona fides ‚Äî being pro-Second Amendment, anti-abortion, pro-business, and the like. Many of them rail against Covid-related closures, praising Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for keeping schools and businesses open throughout the pandemic.

‚ÄúAll across Virginia on day one, we are going to get every single school open ‚Äî five days a week, every single week, with a real, live, breathing teacher in every classroom,‚Äù Snyder told a crowd at a brewery in Wytheville last weekend. ‚ÄúAnd folks, getting the schools open is only the beginning. We need to break the backs of this special interest monopoly of the teachers‚Äô unions and bring real change to our schools.‚Äù

Given the country‚Äôs rate of vaccination, decreased community spread, and reopening, those pandemic issues might not be as relevant come November ‚Äî or in 2022 and beyond. Trump, though, still will be.

At Snyder‚Äôs event, an emcee opened the afternoon by asking, ‚ÄúHow many of you wish Donald Trump was president right now?‚Äù and a one-time Trump operator told the crowd they had to get to work to ‚Äúdefeat the socialists,‚Äù who ‚Äúmight even be worse than socialists, they‚Äôre bordering on communists.‚Äù

Youngkin, for his part, makes sure to note in his stump speech that he‚Äôs won praise from Trump, but he was also willing to criticize the former president‚Äôs tone as ‚Äúa bit harsh‚Äù at a campaign event in northern Virginia.

Loyalty to Trump isn‚Äôt the key thing, argues Peter Doran, a former think tank CEO and one of the other three candidates recognized by the state party. (The others are former Roanoke Sheriff Octavia Johnson and retired Army Col. Sergio de la Pe√±a.)

‚ÄúMost Virginia Republicans are painted as these big hard-right, hard-conservative voters who only care about Donald Trump. That‚Äôs not true,‚Äù Doran said. ‚ÄúThey care about their job. They care about what‚Äôs happening to their kids in this past year, and their education. And they care very deeply about the Republican Party‚Äôs failure to win over the past decade.‚Äù

Wilma, a mother of four and delegate in the convention, agreed, saying the GOP‚Äôs future relies on getting young people to understand conservative values like small government, constitutional rights, and concern about the deficit.

‚ÄúMy kids all look at the stimulus ‚Äî it might be nice to get that money, that cash,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut eventually they know in the long run, they‚Äôre the generation that‚Äôs going to have to pay it back.‚Äù

The culture wars have consumed the GOP

Still, it‚Äôs no longer enough to tick the ‚Äúfiscal conservative,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù ‚Äúgun owner,‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-abortion‚Äù boxes. There are new ones on the list ‚Äî keywords of the culture war issues the former president helped animate.

Take ‚Äúcritical race theory,‚Äù which Chase says is part of the reason she decided to homeschool her children.

As Vox‚Äôs Fabiola Cineas explained, ‚Äúcritical race theory is a framework for grappling with racial power and white supremacy in America.‚Äù But it‚Äôs also become a catch-all term for what the Trump administration thought was an effort to ‚Äúindoctrinate‚Äù American students and workers with ‚Äúdivisive and harmful sex- and race-based ideologies‚Äù:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve lumped everything together: critical race theory, the 1619 project, whiteness studies, talking about white privilege,‚Äù Kimberl√© Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and UCLA and Columbia University law professor, told Vox. ‚ÄúWhat they have in common is they are discourses that refuse to participate in the lie that America has triumphantly overcome its racist history, that everything is behind us. None of these projects accept that it‚Äôs all behind us.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just Chase using the term frequently: Almost all the candidates make sure to highlight their opposition to it; six have signed a pledge opposing critical race theory. As journalist Dave Weigel pointed out on Twitter, Youngkin went so far as to upload multiple video clips of him criticizing it.

Trump‚Äôs impact, though, is perhaps most evident in the obsession with election security.

On one hand, Amanda Chase‚Äôs stance on the 2020 election sets her apart from the rest of the party ‚Äî so much so that she, her supporters, and some outsiders claim the state party chose a convention rather than a primary to mitigate the risk of her ending up at the top of their ticket.

Last month, in an interview with the AP, Chase even questioned whether Biden won Virginia. (He carried it by 10 percentage points, as official election results show.)

But none of the candidates can distance themselves too far from Trump‚Äôs lies and doubt-sowing about the 2020 election. They need only look to the US House to see the consequences of doing so.

This is the key here. Cheney is responding to massive movement across the party to validate 1/6, led by, but by no means limited, to Trump. She‚Äôs not the one forcing this conversation, what annoys her colleagues is she won‚Äôt ignore it. https://t.co/t6QzdKQTkn

‚Äî Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) May 6, 2021

Neither Youngkin nor Snyder will say Biden‚Äôs presidency is legitimate. Cox appears willing to do so (at least when he‚Äôs not at a diner in southwest Virginia).

And everyone has plans to improve election integrity. Youngkin promotes his ‚Äúelection security task force,‚Äù one plank of which is updating voter rolls monthly. He and Cox talk about making the state election commission nonpartisan. Snyder wants to ‚Äúmake Virginia No. 1 in ballot integrity.‚Äù

They‚Äôre all fairly anodyne-sounding proposals, but talking about things like that is a requirement for securing the nomination, says Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.

‚ÄúWhile they may not support what happened on January 6, they do want to offer a position that shows some sympathy to the position of Trump supporters,‚Äù Farnsworth said.

That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the rhetoric will dog them during the general election ‚Äî Youngkin‚Äôs spokesperson said they believe election security isn‚Äôt a partisan issue, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a democracy issue.‚Äù

And ‚ÄúKirk Cox is an example of a candidate who accepts Biden as a legitimate president but nevertheless speaks in ways that gives some solace to Trump supporters,‚Äù Farnsworth pointed out, adding it‚Äôs likely that ‚Äúvoters in November will not be dramatically impacted by what‚Äôs said in May.‚Äù

Still, the insistence on making America‚Äôs elections more secure helps perpetuate a world in which seven out of 10 Republican voters still say ‚Äî per a recent CNN poll ‚Äî that Biden didn‚Äôt win enough votes to be president.

Questioning election integrity is coming home to roost

And the continued questioning of elections has applied even to their own party‚Äôs choices. Some of those choices, admittedly, merit scrutiny from candidates extolling the importance of signatures on absentee ballots. But it also led Youngkin, Cox, and Chase to write to the party, demanding it not use ‚Äúuntested and unproven software that creates uncertainty, lacks openness and transparency, and is inconsistent with our calls as a party for safe and secure elections.‚Äù

Now, every ranked-choice ballot will be counted by hand, at a ballroom at the Richmond Marriott, race by race. Chair Rich Anderson detailed to the Virginia Scope‚Äôs Brandon Jarvis the lengths the Republican Party of Virginia is going to try to instill confidence in the process:

Each ballot ‚Äúwill be seen by several eyes at the same time‚Äù to guard against transposition of numbers.

An out-of-state independent oversight team will be present.

Each candidate can have two representatives in the counting room, a party spokesperson told Vox. And Anderson said they can ‚Äúbe pretty much right up on the ballots, and eyes on them,‚Äù because he wants ‚Äúthem to feel comfortable with the process, to understand it, and have confidence in the final outcomes.‚Äù

The news media can be on site to report, and Anderson says he‚Äôll provide regular updates on social media as well.

They‚Äôve also set aside money to livestream the counting process, because, Anderson said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to repeat what was done in different places around the country where people were concerned about it being an opaque process.‚Äù

That‚Äôs left ‚Äúno room‚Äù for any conspiracy theories about the counting to crop up, says John March, the state party communications director. Even so, there are bound to be some dissidents, and if it takes days, Coleman says he can ‚Äúsee the conspiracy theories now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you have a multi-candidate field in a multi-round election,‚Äù Farnsworth said, ‚Äúthe only sound bet is expecting that the party won‚Äôt get together and sing ‚Äòkumbaya‚Äô when this is all over.‚Äù

Do these Republicans even have a shot in a general election?

Virginia, once home to the capital of the Confederacy, has moved left enough in presidential races that on election night in 2020, the forecast group Decision Desk called it for Joe Biden right as polls closed. Trump ended up with just 44 percent of the vote here, Biden with 54.

But the GOP argues the state is not lost to them just yet.

In recent decades, Virginia had a peevish streak, electing a governor from the opposite party that just won the White House. The candidate to break that trend was former Gov. Terry McAuliffe ‚Äî who‚Äôs running again this year.

And March points to the ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù level of interest in the convention as a sign of what‚Äôs to come: ‚Äú54,000 people are getting involved on the grassroots level. ‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt really see that, and that just shows how excited Virginia Republicans are.‚Äù

Without Trump on the ballot this year, there might be an opening ‚Äî a slim one for the governorship, but a bigger one to flip competitive state House districts. The person Republicans choose on Saturday will matter a lot.

‚ÄúOne thing I do think that could bode well for them is even though he lost, in 2017 Ed Gillespie got more votes than any previous Republican nominee for governor,‚Äù Coleman pointed out. ‚ÄúSo maybe if Youngkin or whoever else can get that type of Gillespie turnout, which is definitely a question mark, and Democrats can‚Äôt get that anti-Trump turnout, maybe it‚Äôs going to be closer.‚Äù

Even so, it‚Äôs going to be an uphill battle for the GOP to narrow margins in some areas, let alone retake them. Take Chesterfield County, which Republicans easily won for decades. In 2020, it went for Biden by more than 6 percentage points.

‚ÄúGoing forward,‚Äù Coleman says, ‚Äúthis may be the last potential cycle where the Republicans could win a county like Chesterfield, and that may not even be enough ‚Äî it may be necessary but not sufficient.‚Äù

Democrats seem to think it won‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready for a fight; we expect a fight. We expect a tough race,‚Äù said David Turner, the communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. ‚ÄúBut what I would say is you can‚Äôt report accurately on the state of Virginia without acknowledging there‚Äôs pre-Trump and there‚Äôs post-Trump, and we‚Äôre still post-Trump.‚Äù"	https://rssdailynews.com/2021/05/09/virginia-republicans-messy-trumpy-race-to-select-a-nominee-for-governor/	"GALAX, Virginia ‚Äî Republican gubernatorial candidate Kirk Cox was several minutes into a wonky election security answer at a diner when January 6 came up again.

Absorption and Radiation of Heat: In 1861, ‚ÄúOn the Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours, and on the Physical Connexion of Radiation, Absorption, and Conduction‚Äù by Irish physicist John Tyndall was published. He was the first to recognize that different atmospheric gases absorb heat (infrared radiation) to different extents and at different wavelengths. In effect, he described and analyzed the molecular basis of the greenhouse effect and named atmospheric gases that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation ‚Äúgreenhouse gases.‚Äù He realized the dominant one is water vapor. He developed infrared spectroscopy, the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength (or frequency).

In 1905, using infrared spectroscopy American physicist William Coblentz published the results of a large study of compounds with wavelengths between 1000 nanometers to 16,000 nanometers. That year he accepted a position with the National Bureau of Standards in Washington (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD.). He founded the Bureau‚Äôs radiometry section and headed it for 40 years until his retirement in 1945. Radiometry is a set of techniques for measuring electromagnetic radiation.

With its fascination for computer modeling over physical evidence the climate establishment, to include the carbon cult, ignores the physical evidence compiled from over 160 years of laboratory research, and over from 40 years of atmospheric observations of the greenhouse effect and resulting atmospheric temperature trends. [Atmospheric temperatures are also influenced by volcanoes and the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)]. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the associated US scientific groups supporting it have abandoned the scientific method of using all relevant physical evidence to correct errors and shortcomings in concepts. [Interestingly, Coblentz received the first US patent for using a solar cell to convert sunlight to electricity.] See links under Seeking a Common Ground and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Coblentz

***************

Intellectual Honesty ‚Äì Science: Over the past month, TWTW has linked to several reviews of Steve Koonin‚Äôs new book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn‚Äôt, and Why It Matters. Writing in Real Clear Energy, Rupert Darwall gives a perceptive review. He begins by discussing a debate between six leading physicists from the American Physical Society (APS), led by Koonin.

‚ÄúThe debate, hosted by the APS, revealed consensus-supporting climate scientists harboring doubts and uncertainties and admitting to holes in climate science ‚Äì in marked contrast to the emphatic messaging of bodies such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

‚ÄúAt one point, Koonin read an extract from the IPCC‚Äôs Fifth Assessment Report released the previous year. Computer model-simulated responses to forcings ‚Äì the term used by climate scientists for changes of energy flows into and out of the climate system, such as changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions, and changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ‚Äì ‚Äòcan be scaled up or down.‚Äô This scaling included greenhouse gas forcings.

‚ÄúSome forcings in some computer models had to be scaled down to match computer simulations to actual climate observations. But when it came to making centennial projections on which governments rely and drive climate policy, the scaling factors were removed, probably resulting in a 25 to 30 percent over-prediction of the 2100 warming.

‚ÄúThe ensuing dialogue between Koonin and Dr. William Collins of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ‚Äì a lead author of the climate model evaluation chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report ‚Äì revealed something more troubling and deliberate than holes in scientific knowledge:

Dr. Koonin: But if the model tells you that you got the response to the forcing wrong by 30 percent, you should use that same 30 percent factor when you project out a century.

Dr. Collins: Yes. And one of the reasons we are not doing that is we are not using the models as [a] statistical projection tool.

Dr. Koonin: What are you using them as?

Dr. Collins: Well, we took exactly the same models that got the forcing wrong, and which got sort of the projections wrong up to 2100.

Dr. Koonin: So, why do we even show centennial-scale projections?

Dr. Collins: Well, I mean, it is part of the [IPCC] assessment process. [Boldface added]

‚ÄòKoonin was uncommonly well-suited to lead the APS climate workshop. He has a deep understanding of computer models, which have become the workhorses of climate science. As a young man, Koonin wrote a paper on computer modeling of nuclear reaction in stars and taught a course on computational physics at Caltech. In the early 1990s, he was involved in a program using satellites to measure the Earth‚Äôs albedo ‚Äì that is, the reflection of incoming solar radiation back into space. As a student at Caltech in the late 1960s, he was taught by Nobel physicist Richard Feynman and absorbed what Koonin calls Feynman‚Äôs ‚Äòabsolute intellectual honesty‚Äô.‚Äù [Boldface added]

From this we see that the modelers lower the greenhouse effect in the models to fit surface temperature observations [atmospheric temperature trends are ignored], but then the modelers ignore these adjustments to make long term projections because that is part of the IPCC process. Therefore, the IPCC process is not intellectually honest. After briefly describing the early part of Koonin‚Äôs career Darwall writes:

‚ÄúThe APS climate debate was the turning point in Koonin‚Äôs thinking about climate change and consensus climate science (‚ÄòThe Science‚Äô). ‚ÄòI began by believing that we were in a race to save the planet from climate catastrophe,‚Äô Koonin writes in his new book, ‚ÄòUnsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn‚Äôt, And Why It Matters.‚Äô ‚ÄòI came away from the APS workshop not only surprised but shaken by the realization that climate science was far less mature than I had supposed.‚Äô ‚ÄòUnsettled‚Äô is an authoritative primer on the science of climate change that lifts the lid on The Science and finds plenty that isn‚Äôt as it should be. ‚ÄòAs a scientist,‚Äô writes Koonin, ‚ÄòI felt the scientific community was letting the public down by not telling the whole truth plainly.‚Äô Koonin‚Äôs aim is to right that wrong.

‚ÄúKoonin‚Äôs indictment of The Science starts with its reliance on unreliable computer models. Usefully describing the earth‚Äôs climate, writes Koonin, is ‚Äòone of the most challenging scientific simulation problems.‚Äô Models divide the atmosphere into pancake-shaped boxes of around 100km wide and one kilometer deep. But the upward flow of energy from tropical thunder clouds, which is more than thirty times larger than that from human influences, occurs over smaller scales than the programmed boxes. This forces climate modellers to make assumptions about what happens inside those boxes. As one modeller confesses, ‚Äòit‚Äôs a real challenge to model what we don‚Äôt understand.‚Äô‚Äù [Boldface added]

Darwall then discusses Koonin‚Äôs presentation of other modeling issues and false claims of weather disasters related to climate. Then he brings up the critical question concerning humanity:

‚Äú‚ÄòThe economic betterment of most of humanity in the coming decades will drive energy demand even more strongly than population growth,‚Äô Koonin says. ‚ÄòWho will pay the developing world not to emit? I have been posing that simple question to many people for more than fifteen years and have yet to hear a convincing answer.‚Äô [Boldface added]

‚ÄúThe most unsettling part of ‚ÄòUnsettled‚Äô concerns science and the role of scientists. ‚ÄòScience is one of the very few human activities ‚Äì perhaps the only one ‚Äì in which errors are systematically criticized and fairly often, in time, corrected,‚Äô Karl Popper wrote nearly six decades ago. That condition does not pertain in climate science, where errors are embedded in a political narrative and criticism is suppressed. In a recent essay, the philosopher Matthew B. Crawford observes that the pride of science as a way of generating knowledge ‚Äì unlike religion ‚Äì is to be falsifiable. That changes when science is pressed into duty as authority in order to absolve politicians of responsibility for justifying their policy choices (‚Äòthe science says,‚Äô we‚Äôre repeatedly told). ‚ÄòYet what sort of authority would it be that insists its own grasp of reality is merely provisional?‚Äô asks Crawford. ‚ÄòFor authority to be really authoritative, it must claim an epistemic monopoly of some kind, whether of priestly or scientific knowledge.‚Äô [Boldface added]

‚ÄúAt the outset of ‚ÄòUnsettled,‚Äô Feynman‚Äôs axiom of absolute intellectual honesty is contrasted with climate scientist Stephen Schneider‚Äôs ‚Äòdouble ethical bind.‚Äô On the one hand, scientists are ethically bound by the scientific method to tell the truth. On the other, they are human beings who want to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change. ‚ÄòEach of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest,‚Äô Schneider said.

‚Äú‚ÄòBeing effective‚Äô helps explain the pressure on climate scientists to conform to The Science and the emergence of a climate science knowledge monopoly. Its function is, as Crawford puts it, the manufacture of a product ‚Äì political legitimacy ‚Äì which, in turn, requires that competing views be delegitimized and driven out of public discourse through enforcement of a ‚Äòmoratorium on the asking of questions.‚Äô This sees climate scientist gatekeepers deciding who can and cannot opine on climate science. ‚ÄòPlease, save us from retired physicists who think they‚Äôre smarter and wiser than everyone in climate science,‚Äô tweeted Gavin Schmidt, NASA acting senior climate advisor, about Koonin and his book. ‚ÄòI agree with pretty much everything you wrote,‚Äô a chair of a university earth sciences department tells Koonin, ‚Äòbut I don‚Äôt dare say that in public.‚Äô Another scientist criticizes Koonin for giving ammunition to ‚Äòthe deniers,‚Äô and a third writes an op-ed urging New York University to reconsider Koonin‚Äôs position there. It goes wider than scientists. Facebook has suppressed a ‚ÄòWall Street Journal‚Äô review of ‚ÄòUnsettled.‚Äô Likewise, ‚ÄòUnsettled‚Äô remains unreviewed by the ‚ÄòNew York Times,‚Äô the ‚ÄòWashington Post‚Äô (though it carried an op-ed by Marc Thiessen based on an interview with Koonin) and other dailies, which would prefer to treat Koonin‚Äôs reasoned climate dissent as though it doesn‚Äôt exist. [Boldface added.]

‚ÄúThe moratorium on the asking of questions represents the death of science as understood and described by Popper, a victim of the conflicting requirements of political utility and scientific integrity. Many scientists take this lying down. Koonin won‚Äôt. For his forensic skill and making his findings accessible to non-specialists, Koonin has written the most important book on climate science in decades.‚Äù

The Carbon Cult, including Gavin Schmidt of NASA, ignores that over the past 30 years China, and much of South Asia, has been emerging from extreme poverty. That 60 years ago China was in probably the worst man-made famine of the 20th century, the result of deranged Maoist policies. (which many Western journalists praised). China is not about to embrace policies curtailing growth based on climate models that are contradicted by physical evidence. Rather than address the critical issues raised in the book, the Carbon Cult attacks the author. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.

Intellectual Honesty ‚Äì Politics: In a rather unusual essay, Professor of Mathematics Jordan Ellenberg writes in the Wall Street Journal:

‚ÄúIn 1865, the Reverend J.P. Gulliver asked Abraham Lincoln how he came to acquire his famous rhetorical skill. The President gave an unusual response:

‚Äú‚ÄòIn the course of my law-reading I constantly came upon the word ‚Äòdemonstrate.‚Äô I thought, at first, that I understood its meaning, but soon became satisfied that I did not‚Ä¶. At last, I said, ‚ÄòLincoln, you can never make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means‚Äô; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father‚Äôs house, and stayed there till I could give any propositions in the six books of Euclid at sight.‚Äô

‚ÄúGeometry is the cilantro of math: Few people have neutral feelings about it.

‚ÄúNot the Constitution, not scripture, but geometry‚Äîthat‚Äôs where Lincoln went when he needed to learn to persuade. Euclid was a mathematician in Greek North Africa in the 4th century B.C., who gathered and systematized the geometric knowledge of his day. His ‚ÄòElements,‚Äô in Lincoln‚Äôs time and to a lesser extent our own, is the standard model of mathematical proof or ‚Äòdemonstration.‚Äô Starting with axioms that the reader can hardly doubt, Euclid builds up a rich body of knowledge about angles, line segments, circles and figures, step by careful step.

After discussing how some students hate geometry while others love it, the author states:

[Lincoln‚Äôs law partner] ‚ÄúHerndon once found Lincoln in a haggard state, having spent two full days trying to solve the old conundrum of squaring the circle. ‚ÄòHis attempt to establish the proposition having ended in failure,‚Äô Herndon remembers, ‚Äòwe, in the office, suspected that he was more or less sensitive about it and were therefore discreet enough to avoid referring to it.‚Äô‚Äù

After a discussion of changes to geometry since Euclid and Lincoln, the author concludes:

‚ÄúBut Abraham Lincoln wasn‚Äôt an AI developer or a paradigm-busting pure mathematician. His interest in Euclid arose, as he told Rev. Gulliver, because he needed to know what ‚Äòproof‚Äô was. What distinguished Lincoln as a thinker, his friend and fellow lawyer Henry Clay Whitney recalled, wasn‚Äôt his brilliance; lots of people in public life are smart, and among them one finds both the good and the bad. What made Lincoln special was integrity, his belief that you should not say something unless you have demonstrated that it is right. Whitney writes: ‚ÄòIt was morally impossible for Lincoln to argue dishonestly; he could no more do it than he could steal; it was the same thing to him in essence, to despoil a man of his property by larceny, or by illogical or flagitious reasoning.‚Äô [Boldface added.]

‚ÄúIn Euclid, Lincoln found a language in which it‚Äôs very hard to dissimulate, cheat or dodge the question. Geometry is a form of honesty. [Boldface added.]

‚ÄúThe ultimate reason for young people to learn how to write a proof is that the world is full of bad logic, and we need to know the difference. Geometry teaches us to be skeptical when someone says they‚Äôre ‚Äòjust being logical.‚Äô If they are talking about an economic policy, or a cultural figure whose behavior they deplore, or a concession they want you to make in a relationship, rather than a congruence of triangles, they aren‚Äôt just being logical. They want you to mistake an assertively expressed chain of opinions for proof of a theorem. [Boldface added.]

‚ÄúKnowing geometry protects you: Once you‚Äôve experienced the sharp click of an honest-to-goodness proof, you‚Äôll never fall for this trick again. Tell your ‚Äòlogical‚Äô opponent to go square a circle.‚Äù [Boldface added.]

To TWTW it appears that those following the IPCC process are attempting to square a circle. See Article # 2.

Flawed Statistical Practices: Writing in Climate Etc. Stanley Young and Warren Kindzierski bring attention to a study they did with David Randall on the flawed statistical practices used in the field of environmental epidemiology.

‚ÄúThe study focused on air quality‚àíhealth effect claims; more specifically PM2.5‚àíhealth effect claims. [PM2.5 is particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in width, the size of the smallest ordinary plant pollen.] However, the flawed practices apply to all aspects of risk factor‚àíchronic disease research. The study also looked at how government bureaucrats use these claims to skew policy in favor of PM2.5 regulation and their own positions.‚Äù

The EPA is one of many agencies that abuse statistical techniques to promote particular policies bureaucrats and politicians desire. Young and Kindzierski write:

‚ÄúOur study found strong circumstantial evidence that claims made about PM2.5 causing mortality, heart attacks and asthma are compromised by flawed statistical practices. These flawed practices make the research untrustworthy as it favors producing false claims that would not reproduce if done properly.‚Äù

This problem is becoming more acute, because PM2.5 is being used to eliminate the use of hydrocarbons even though properly ventilated exhausts from modern power plants and vehicles are harmless to humans. The use of studies by government entities is inexcusable if the studies cannot be reproduced.

Of course, many climate scientists claim that climate, and the effect of carbon dioxide on it, cannot be reproduced, even though they continue to use climate models that are contradicted by physical evidence. But this is a ‚Äústrawman argument‚Äù because the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide has been studied and reproduced in numerous laboratories for decades since John Tyndall in 1861. Further, observations of the atmospheric influence of the greenhouse effect and atmospheric temperature trends have been made for over four decades. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.

********************

Environmental Justice? In his blog, Manhattan Contrarian, Francis Menton brings attention to the latest effort of the Biden Administration to shut down the oil and gas industries. It is the ‚ÄúInterim Final Recommendations‚Äù of the ‚ÄúWhite House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.‚Äù The claimed purpose is to guide ‚Äúhow certain Federal investments (spending) might be made toward a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits flow to disadvantaged communities.‚Äù

This may sound rosy, but it excludes ‚ÄúFossil fuel procurement, development, infrastructure repair that would in any way extend lifespan or production capacity, transmission system investments to facilitate fossil-fired generation or any related subsidy.‚Äù Under the guise of Environmental Justice, the Biden administration is advancing a program to destroy a major US industry without a suitable replacement for the absolutely essential product: reliable energy. See links under Change in US Administrations.

********************

Social Cost of Carbon: David Wojick of CFACT brings attention to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) soliciting comments on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases such as Carbon Dioxide, Methane, etc. but not water vapor, the dominant greenhouse gas. No doubt a major component of the costs will be greatly exaggerated costs of PM2.5 and the enormous benefits of CO2 on vegetation will be ignored.

There is no reason to expect that OMB would pay attention to any criticism. But a record of what the OMB ignores can be established. According to the OMB web site:

‚ÄúTo ensure consideration, comments must be in writing and received by June 21, 2021.

SEPP‚ÄôS APRIL FOOLS AWARD

THE JACKSON

SEPP is conducting its annual vote for the recipient of the coveted trophy, The Jackson, a lump of coal. Readers are asked to nominate and vote for who they think is most deserving, following these criteria:

The nominee has advanced, or proposes to advance, significant expansion of governmental power, regulation, or control over the public or significant sections of the general economy.

The nominee does so by declaring such measures are necessary to protect public health, welfare, or the environment.

The nominee declares that physical science supports such measures.

The physical science supporting the measures is flimsy at best, and possibly non-existent.

The past recipients, Lisa Jackson, Barrack Obama, John Kerry, Ernest Moniz, Michael Mann, Christiana Figueres, Jerry Brown, AOC, and Neil Ferguson are not eligible. Generally, the committee that makes the selection prefers a candidate with a national or international presence. The voting will close on July 31. Please send your nominee and a brief reason why the person is qualified for the honor to Ken@SEPP.org. Thank you. For a list of past recipients and their accomplishments in earning this honor see http://www.sepp.org/april-fools-award.cfm

Number of the Week: ‚Äì $18 Trillion for Zero. In an article on financing green energy ventures, reporters for the Wall Street Journal showed an amazing graph prepared from data by Wood Mackenzie on ‚ÄúEstimated cumulative spending by category to get to net-zero emissions by 2050‚Äù assuming the rest of the world goes along with the UN dreams.

The total estimated spending required is $49.4 Trillion! The largest component is Power Transmission, with $18 Trillion or 36%. Power transmission generates zero electrical power, only transmits it. There is no need to increase power transmission in developed countries!

The next two large components are Wind with $11.6 Trillion and Solar with $7.5 Trillion bringing the sub total to $37.1 Trillion or 75% of the total. Wind and solar do not generate reliable power, yet 75% of the estimated costs are going to unreliable power generation or transmission. No wonder green industries and their promoters are giddy. Trillions are to be spent for no reason than to allow politicians to feel good. See Article # 3.

From the summary:

‚ÄúIce core data across Antarctica show increasing sea salt concentrations since 11,400 years ago, representing cooling and sea ice expansion, particularly between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. Between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, a drop in sea salt indicates an abrupt reduction in sea ice cover in the South Atlantic. Interestingly, paleoclimate data suggest that sea ice was more extensive in the North Atlantic at this time, indicating a linked and opposing sea ice signal in the North and South Atlantic most likely due to changing ocean circulation.‚Äù

1. Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄòFact Checks‚Äô Suppress Debate

The social-media site seeks to discredit a review of my book on climate science.

By Steven E. Koonin, WSJ, May 16, 2021

https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-fact-checks-suppress-debate-11621194172?mod=hp_opin_pos_3

TWTW Summary: Koonin states:

‚ÄúThis paper published Mark Mills‚Äôs review of ‚ÄòUnsettled,‚Äô my book on climate science, on April 25. Eight days later, 11 self-appointed ‚Äòfact checkers‚Äô weighed in with a 4,500-word critique on the website ClimateFeedback.org. Facebook is waving that fact check as a giant red flag whenever the review appears in anyone‚Äôs feed.

‚ÄúBy branding Mr. Mills‚Äôs review with ‚Äòvery low scientific credibility,‚Äô the company directs its billions of users to a website that claims to discredit the review and, by direct implication, my book. This action adds to the growing suppression of open discussion of climate complexities.

‚ÄúClimateFeedback bills itself as ‚Äòa worldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in climate change media coverage.‚Äô Its modus operandi is to label necessarily brief media statements as misleading or inaccurate, often because they lack context. While acknowledging that ‚Äòglobal crop yields are rising,‚Äô for instance, they add the untestable claim that yields might have been greater absent human-caused climate change. The gang of enforcers who ‚Äòfact checked‚Äô Mr. Mills‚Äôs review included professors from Stanford, UCLA and MIT.

‚ÄúThe oddest element of Facebook‚Äôs action is that the ‚Äòfact check‚Äô doesn‚Äôt challenge anything I wrote in ‚ÄòUnsettled,‚Äô but rather provides ‚Äòcontext‚Äô for Mr. Mills‚Äôs statements.‚Äù

After stating two reviewers agree that extreme weather events are not increasing, Koonin continues:

But another contributor, Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor who hasn‚Äôt read my book, disapproves of the statement because ‚Äòit sets up a strawman‚Äô to disparage climate predictions. It seems Mr. Emanuel would allow media to discuss only deleterious climate trends.

Thoughtful challenge and dialogue are the most powerful ways that science gets closer to truth. But Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äòfact checkers‚Äô criticized what they imagined I wrote based on a 900-word review, rather than what I did write in a book of more than 75,000 words. They‚Äôre no better than trolls who pan political adversaries‚Äô books on Amazon without bothering to read them. It‚Äôs not the behavior of serious scientists, and it demonstrates the need for a book like ‚ÄòUnsettled.‚Äô

Wise responses to the changing climate require that we get the unfiltered certainties and uncertainties of climate science into the public dialogue. As most fair-minded people will discover, there is far more unsettled in the official United Nations and U.S. government reports than we have been led to believe. It doesn‚Äôt help to have Facebook spreading disinformation under the guise of ‚Äòfact checking.‚Äô

('projects poll bound', 0.4893)	Virginia Republicans‚Äô messy, Trumpy race to pick a nominee for governor	"Update, May 10: Businessman Glenn Youngkin has won the Republican gubernatorial nomination.

GALAX, Virginia ‚Äî Republican gubernatorial candidate Kirk Cox was several minutes into a wonky election security answer at a diner when January 6 came up again.

Did President Joe Biden win the election? Cox avoided directly answering the question at this recent event, though he had previously acknowledged that reality, the one GOP frontrunner willing to do so.

Instead, he refocused on proposals like voter ID requirements, which are popular with lots of voters. But now Lin, a Trump supporter who had posed the Biden question, had another one. She wanted to know whether he agreed with the Virginia Senate censuring one of its members, Amanda Chase, after she called the people who stormed the US Capitol that day in January ‚Äúpatriots.‚Äù

Did Cox support the ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù of Chase, now one of Cox‚Äôs competitors for the Republican nomination?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very much for freedom of speech,‚Äù Cox answered.

‚ÄúSo you were against [the censure vote]?‚Äù asked Lin, who supports Chase in the race. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put words in your mouth, but I need a ‚Äòyes‚Äô or a ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù

This narrow line on the 2020 election and cancel culture is one Republicans have had to dance along for months in courting voters before Saturday‚Äôs Virginia GOP gubernatorial convention.

Sign up for The Weeds newsletter Vox‚Äôs German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration‚Äôs unprecedented burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday.

The GOP has had a tough go of it statewide in the past few years in Virginia, with demographic changes helping push the state to become reliably Democratic. The party‚Äôs response ‚Äî running further and further to the right ‚Äî has only exacerbated the problem. But Virginia might not be lost to the right kind of Republican. At least not yet.

Republicans will choose their nominee in an ‚Äúunassembled convention‚Äù; nearly 54,000 Republicans who successfully applied to be a delegate will be able to cast ranked-choice ballots at 39 drive-up locations around Virginia. It‚Äôs a process that has had more than a few bumps along the way, including Chase alleging the party chose a convention over a primary to prevent her from becoming the nominee. It could also take several days to know the results ‚Äî candidates have already sown doubt about the race.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to make the Iowa caucuses look like a well-oiled machine,‚Äù a Democratic operative said, with a touch of hopeful glee.

The candidates represent a few ways the GOP could go in Virginia

Virginia last chose a Republican in a statewide election in 2009. Since then, the GOP has run candidates that its own insiders say don‚Äôt appeal to the state‚Äôs growing suburban population. They‚Äôre going to have to make inroads back into those communities to have a hope of winning, says Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato‚Äôs Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics.

‚ÄúI always look at, in the 2016 primaries, places where candidates like John Kasich and Marco Rubio did well against Trump: Those are the areas that have moved more toward the Democrats since ‚Äî places like Loudoun County, Hanover County, Chesterfield County,‚Äù Coleman said. ‚ÄúMaybe those voters are still open to the right type of Republican after voting for Hillary [Clinton] and Biden.‚Äù

But can they do that while turning out the 44 percent of the state that went for Trump?

The mix of contenders has been revealing.

But regardless of how candidates are positioning themselves, there are certain issues that keep coming up on the trail: support for law enforcement, the eradication of ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù from schools, and election integrity, to name a few.

And for some voters, like Heather, who attended Cox‚Äôs event in Galax, the last on that list is most important ‚Äî or, more specifically, it‚Äôs the question of whether Joe Biden won the 2020 election that matters most.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs first and foremost for this election or any election.‚Äù

Virginia Republicans want to stay competitive ‚Äî and keep conservatives on board

The future of the GOP after Trump is an open question. And barring disputes like the one playing out between US Rep. Liz Cheney and the bulk of the House GOP right now, Virginia might be the best glimpse we get before the 2022 midterms.

Here‚Äôs what it looks like: There are seven candidates running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, with four in real contention (Youngkin, Chase, Cox, and Snyder). All of them tout their traditional conservative bona fides ‚Äî being pro-Second Amendment, anti-abortion, pro-business, and the like. Many of them rail against Covid-related closures, praising Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for keeping schools and businesses open throughout the pandemic.

‚ÄúAll across Virginia on day one, we are going to get every single school open ‚Äî five days a week, every single week, with a real, live, breathing teacher in every classroom,‚Äù Snyder told a crowd at a brewery in Wytheville last weekend. ‚ÄúAnd folks, getting the schools open is only the beginning. We need to break the backs of this special interest monopoly of the teachers‚Äô unions and bring real change to our schools.‚Äù

Given the country‚Äôs rate of vaccination, decreased community spread, and reopening, those pandemic issues might not be as relevant come November ‚Äî or in 2022 and beyond. Trump, though, still will be.

At Snyder‚Äôs event, an emcee opened the afternoon by asking, ‚ÄúHow many of you wish Donald Trump was president right now?‚Äù and a one-time Trump operator told the crowd they had to get to work to ‚Äúdefeat the socialists,‚Äù who ‚Äúmight even be worse than socialists, they‚Äôre bordering on communists.‚Äù

Youngkin, for his part, makes sure to note in his stump speech that he‚Äôs won praise from Trump, but he was also willing to criticize the former president‚Äôs tone as ‚Äúa bit harsh‚Äù at a campaign event in northern Virginia.

Loyalty to Trump isn‚Äôt the key thing, argues Peter Doran, a former think tank CEO and one of the other three candidates recognized by the state party. (The others are former Roanoke Sheriff Octavia Johnson and retired Army Col. Sergio de la Pe√±a.)

‚ÄúMost Virginia Republicans are painted as these big hard-right, hard-conservative voters who only care about Donald Trump. That‚Äôs not true,‚Äù Doran said. ‚ÄúThey care about their job. They care about what‚Äôs happening to their kids in this past year, and their education. And they care very deeply about the Republican Party‚Äôs failure to win over the past decade.‚Äù

Wilma, a mother of four and delegate in the convention, agreed, saying the GOP‚Äôs future relies on getting young people to understand conservative values like small government, constitutional rights, and concern about the deficit.

‚ÄúMy kids all look at the stimulus ‚Äî it might be nice to get that money, that cash,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut eventually they know in the long run, they‚Äôre the generation that‚Äôs going to have to pay it back.‚Äù

The culture wars have consumed the GOP

Still, it‚Äôs no longer enough to tick the ‚Äúfiscal conservative,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù ‚Äúgun owner,‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-abortion‚Äù boxes. There are new ones on the list ‚Äî keywords of the culture war issues the former president helped animate.

Take ‚Äúcritical race theory,‚Äù which Chase says is part of the reason she decided to homeschool her children.

As Vox‚Äôs Fabiola Cineas explained, ‚Äúcritical race theory is a framework for grappling with racial power and white supremacy in America.‚Äù But it‚Äôs also become a catch-all term for what the Trump administration thought was an effort to ‚Äúindoctrinate‚Äù American students and workers with ‚Äúdivisive and harmful sex- and race-based ideologies‚Äù:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve lumped everything together: critical race theory, the 1619 project, whiteness studies, talking about white privilege,‚Äù Kimberl√© Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and UCLA and Columbia University law professor, told Vox. ‚ÄúWhat they have in common is they are discourses that refuse to participate in the lie that America has triumphantly overcome its racist history, that everything is behind us. None of these projects accept that it‚Äôs all behind us.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just Chase using the term frequently: Almost all the candidates make sure to highlight their opposition to it; six have signed a pledge opposing critical race theory. As journalist Dave Weigel pointed out on Twitter, Youngkin went so far as to upload multiple video clips of him criticizing it.

Trump‚Äôs impact, though, is perhaps most evident in the obsession with election security.

On one hand, Amanda Chase‚Äôs stance on the 2020 election sets her apart from the rest of the party ‚Äî so much so that she, her supporters, and some outsiders claim the state party chose a convention rather than a primary to mitigate the risk of her ending up at the top of their ticket.

Last month, in an interview with the AP, Chase even questioned whether Biden won Virginia. (He carried it by 10 percentage points, as official election results show.)

But none of the candidates can distance themselves too far from Trump‚Äôs lies and doubt-sowing about the 2020 election. They need only look to the US House to see the consequences of doing so.

This is the key here. Cheney is responding to massive movement across the party to validate 1/6, led by, but by no means limited, to Trump. She‚Äôs not the one forcing this conversation, what annoys her colleagues is she won‚Äôt ignore it. https://t.co/t6QzdKQTkn ‚Äî Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) May 6, 2021

Neither Youngkin nor Snyder will say Biden‚Äôs presidency is legitimate. Cox appears willing to do so (at least when he‚Äôs not at a diner in southwest Virginia).

And everyone has plans to improve election integrity. Youngkin promotes his ‚Äúelection security task force,‚Äù one plank of which is updating voter rolls monthly. He and Cox talk about making the state election commission nonpartisan. Snyder wants to ‚Äúmake Virginia No. 1 in ballot integrity.‚Äù

They‚Äôre all fairly anodyne-sounding proposals, but talking about things like that is a requirement for securing the nomination, says Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.

‚ÄúWhile they may not support what happened on January 6, they do want to offer a position that shows some sympathy to the position of Trump supporters,‚Äù Farnsworth said.

That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the rhetoric will dog them during the general election ‚Äî Youngkin‚Äôs spokesperson said they believe election security isn‚Äôt a partisan issue, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a democracy issue.‚Äù

And ‚ÄúKirk Cox is an example of a candidate who accepts Biden as a legitimate president but nevertheless speaks in ways that gives some solace to Trump supporters,‚Äù Farnsworth pointed out, adding it‚Äôs likely that ‚Äúvoters in November will not be dramatically impacted by what‚Äôs said in May.‚Äù

Still, the insistence on making America‚Äôs elections more secure helps perpetuate a world in which seven out of 10 Republican voters still say ‚Äî per a recent CNN poll ‚Äî that Biden didn‚Äôt win enough votes to be president.

Questioning election integrity is coming home to roost

And the continued questioning of elections has applied even to their own party‚Äôs choices. Some of those choices, admittedly, merit scrutiny from candidates extolling the importance of signatures on absentee ballots. But it also led Youngkin, Cox, and Chase to write to the party, demanding it not use ‚Äúuntested and unproven software that creates uncertainty, lacks openness and transparency, and is inconsistent with our calls as a party for safe and secure elections.‚Äù

Now, every ranked-choice ballot will be counted by hand, at a ballroom at the Richmond Marriott, race by race. Chair Rich Anderson detailed to the Virginia Scope‚Äôs Brandon Jarvis the lengths the Republican Party of Virginia is going to try to instill confidence in the process:

Each ballot ‚Äúwill be seen by several eyes at the same time‚Äù to guard against transposition of numbers.

An out-of-state independent oversight team will be present.

Each candidate can have two representatives in the counting room, a party spokesperson told Vox. And Anderson said they can ‚Äúbe pretty much right up on the ballots, and eyes on them,‚Äù because he wants ‚Äúthem to feel comfortable with the process, to understand it, and have confidence in the final outcomes.‚Äù

The news media can be on site to report, and Anderson says he‚Äôll provide regular updates on social media as well.

They‚Äôve also set aside money to livestream the counting process, because, Anderson said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to repeat what was done in different places around the country where people were concerned about it being an opaque process.‚Äù

That‚Äôs left ‚Äúno room‚Äù for any conspiracy theories about the counting to crop up, says John March, the state party communications director. Even so, there are bound to be some dissidents, and if it takes days, Coleman says he can ‚Äúsee the conspiracy theories now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you have a multi-candidate field in a multi-round election,‚Äù Farnsworth said, ‚Äúthe only sound bet is expecting that the party won‚Äôt get together and sing ‚Äòkumbaya‚Äô when this is all over.‚Äù

Do these Republicans even have a shot in a general election?

Virginia, once home to the capital of the Confederacy, has moved left enough in presidential races that on election night in 2020, the forecast group Decision Desk called it for Joe Biden right as polls closed. Trump ended up with just 44 percent of the vote here, Biden with 54.

But the GOP argues the state is not lost to them just yet.

In recent decades, Virginia had a peevish streak, electing a governor from the opposite party that just won the White House. The candidate to break that trend was former Gov. Terry McAuliffe ‚Äî who‚Äôs running again this year.

And March points to the ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù level of interest in the convention as a sign of what‚Äôs to come: ‚Äú54,000 people are getting involved on the grassroots level. ... You don‚Äôt really see that, and that just shows how excited Virginia Republicans are.‚Äù

Without Trump on the ballot this year, there might be an opening ‚Äî a slim one for the governorship, but a bigger one to flip competitive state House districts. The person Republicans choose on Saturday will matter a lot.

‚ÄúOne thing I do think that could bode well for them is even though he lost, in 2017 Ed Gillespie got more votes than any previous Republican nominee for governor,‚Äù Coleman pointed out. ‚ÄúSo maybe if Youngkin or whoever else can get that type of Gillespie turnout, which is definitely a question mark, and Democrats can‚Äôt get that anti-Trump turnout, maybe it‚Äôs going to be closer.‚Äù

Even so, it‚Äôs going to be an uphill battle for the GOP to narrow margins in some areas, let alone retake them. Take Chesterfield County, which Republicans easily won for decades. In 2020, it went for Biden by more than 6 percentage points.

‚ÄúGoing forward,‚Äù Coleman says, ‚Äúthis may be the last potential cycle where the Republicans could win a county like Chesterfield, and that may not even be enough ‚Äî it may be necessary but not sufficient.‚Äù

Democrats seem to think it won‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready for a fight; we expect a fight. We expect a tough race,‚Äù said David Turner, the communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. ‚ÄúBut what I would say is you can‚Äôt report accurately on the state of Virginia without acknowledging there‚Äôs pre-Trump and there‚Äôs post-Trump, and we‚Äôre still post-Trump.‚Äù"	https://www.vox.com/22423524/virginia-gop-trump-convention-governor-election	"GALAX, Virginia ‚Äî Republican gubernatorial candidate Kirk Cox was several minutes into a wonky election security answer at a diner when January 6 came up again.

('projects poll bound', 0.4893)	Tory dominance is likely to hasten break-up of the union	"Boris Johnson likes to talk about his commitment to the United Kingdom‚Äôs ‚Äúprecious union‚Äù. But last Thursday‚Äôs elections call into question the future of his increasingly divided country.

In England, Johnson is master of all he surveys. Indeed, a 30ft inflatable blimp of the Conservative prime minister looked down over Hartlepool as the Tories won a stunning byelection victory in Labour‚Äôs once blood-red northern heartlands.

A few hours later, and less than a hundred miles up the road, Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon effectively declared victory, and an unprecedented fourth consecutive term in office for the SNP in Edinburgh. Even in Wales, long the forgotten son of British politics, the stridently pro-devolution Labour party confounded polls to consolidate its power in Cardiff Bay.

Such political promiscuity might be held up as evidence that devolution works: different electorates in different parts of the country voting for different parties. But in reality, the results of Thursday‚Äôs elections are likely to herald a crescendo in the UK‚Äôs mounting constitutional crisis.

Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äòmuscular unionism‚Äô is proving to be catnip for English voters, particularly in Leave constituencies

Unionist tactical voting helped ensure that the SNP fell just short of outright victory, but the pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament has increased. Sturgeon hailed it as an ‚Äúemphatic‚Äù mandate for a second referendum. This ‚Äúbattle of the mandates‚Äù between London and Edinburgh could end up in the courts.

None of this is likely to sway Boris Johnson. The prime minister said at the weekend that he would invite the devolved leaders to a ‚ÄúTeam UK‚Äù summit ‚Äì but only after confirming that he would not countenance another Scottish independence vote.

Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äúmuscular unionism‚Äù is proving to be catnip for English voters, particularly in Leave constituencies. Many of Britain‚Äôs right-of-centre newspaper columnists lap it up, too.

But the Tories‚Äô electoral success comes at a potentially great cost to the union itself. The post-war ‚Äì and post-empire ‚Äì United Kingdom was held together in large part by social democratic reforms. The welfare state, particularly the NHS, bound Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúnations and regions‚Äù.

In trying to force a unionism into a single form, Johnson and his colleagues are inadvertently flagging up its weaknesses

Now British unionism comes in a single shade of red, white and blue. A Union Unit has been set up in Downing Street, overseen by Michael Gove. When not beset by in-fighting, most of the unit‚Äôs proposals for ‚Äústrengthening‚Äù the union have revolved around ‚Äúbetter branding‚Äù for projects financed by the British treasury. Last November the unit reportedly asked for vials of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine to be labelled with the union flag.

This is not how unionism has traditionally prospered. For centuries, unionism has taken on different forms in different places, from Orange walks in Ballymena to bake sales in Berwick. In Scotland the once dominant Tories, then Labour, were essentially nationalist unionists: each were pro-UK but won votes on promising to defend local interests. Such heterogeneity was key to the union‚Äôs success.

In trying to force a unionism into a single form, Johnson and his colleagues are inadvertently flagging up its weaknesses. The union has always worked best when nobody talked about it. Johnson‚Äôs muscular unionism increasingly serves to highlight ‚Äì and accentuate ‚Äì the union‚Äôs underlying tensions.

The devolution settlement that saw the establishment of Scottish and Welsh parliaments at the end of the 20th century radically changed all British politics ‚Äì except at the centre. While Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast became seats of new-found power, London remained the same.

Many voters came to see their devolved parliaments as the primary source of sovereignty ‚Äì even if legislative power technically rests in Westminster. The UK‚Äôs place in the EU papered over many of these tensions. Powers that might otherwise have been contested between different layers of government were often devolved to Brussels.

Brexit brought this constructive ambiguity to a shuddering halt. Since becoming prime minister in 2019, Johnson has sharply increased the power of the executive. In the name of parliamentary sovereignty ‚Äì and better regulating the UK‚Äôs ‚Äúinternal market‚Äù ‚Äì power has been centralised in Westminster.

Far from strengthening the UK, the Conservatives‚Äô political dominance will likely hasten its break-up. The Tories have realised that there are votes to be won by being seen as standing up for English interests against the rest of the union.

The UK is listing towards a constitutional crisis

Ever since David Cameron‚Äôs election posters of then Labour leader Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond‚Äôs pocket propelled Cameron to victory in 2015, successive Tory leaders have pushed this once-taboo message. It is no coincidence that the better the Conservatives do in England, the stronger the SNP performs.

Meanwhile, English views on the union are increasingly defined by ambivalence. Polls in 2019 suggested the vast majority of Conservative voters would happily see the UK break up if it meant delivering Brexit.

There might be some cause for comfort for less muscular unionists. Welsh Labour topped the polls, winning enough seats to govern alone. But Mark Drakeford‚Äôs unabashed Wales-centric strain of unionism increasingly feels like a minority concern outside the principality.

In Scotland the Tories finished second after a campaign that had revolved around a single policy: opposition to independence. The leaders of the two main unionist parties in Northern Ireland have resigned in recent weeks.

The UK is listing towards a constitutional crisis. Without an outright SNP majority, Sturgeon‚Äôs demands for a referendum might be tempered but they will not disappear. Neither will the question of a Border poll in Ireland.

A looser, more federal interpretation of Britain‚Äôs uncodified constitution could allow for divergence while retaining the union‚Äôs integrity ‚Äì but in a contest between Boris Johnson‚Äôs electoral interests and the union, there will only be one winner.

Telling Scots there is no democratic route out of the union is not a long-term solution, much less the basis for a thriving partnership. Yet, with no solid majority for Scottish independence ‚Äì or Irish reunification ‚Äì Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äúprecious‚Äù union could yet limp on for years. History, however, suggests such a divided country is unlikely to stay united for ever.

While wind power is not emission-free and independent from fossil fuels, wind farms produce far fewer net emissions than traditional fossil fuel power generation. Social media posts mocked renewable energy as “unreliables.” A Wall Street Journal editorial called for more reliance on coal to help endure frigid temperatures. Trump emphasized oil, gas and coal production on federal lands over the fight against climate change. “People are spending millions of dollars to hobble the wind industry,” moderator Chris Tomlinson, a Houston Chronicle columnist, said at the panel, claiming that there are lobbyists in Austin who have been told to spend nearly half their time opposing the wind industry. The procedure then takes about 90 minutes to de-ice a wind turbine. Saipem, a market leader in subsea exploration and construction, has been shifting its focus to offshore wind and renewable energy to meet growing client demand for green technologies. “Our infrastructure cannot handle extreme weather events, which these fossil fuels are ironically causing.” “It is President Biden’s agenda, not my own agenda that I would be moving forward,” she said at the contentious confirmation hearing that reflected deep divisions over some of Biden’s climate-focused executive orders. The fossil fuel industry has also made it clear that it sees wind power in Texas as a threat to its business.	mocked renewable energy, fight climate change, fossil fuels ironically, posts mocked renewable, renewable energy unreliables	"     Similarity Score  ...

No one, from the leaders of our world, will stop us from taking this fight to the next level. The goal is the same: the destruction of the planet and the destruction of all knowledge. In some areas of reality more resources will be saved than time and resources can be reduced. The final answer to saving mankind is the destruction of the planet.

Rise of the Empire

It is a global conflict with no one's end in sight as there cannot be peace in this world. There will be major conflicts all over again in every region of the world. The planet will be wiped out again by a war between civilizations. On a world where every one of the empires dominates, there is no hope. This will be one of history's major milestones. The events of the present will drive mankind to the brink of a crisis and destroy civilization. In the coming days, we are going to go through the events of the present and create the last remnants left. The world is about to be turned upside down and will fall apart.

In the aftermath of the Great Nuclear Event, a powerful asteroid collided with our planet and wiped out all life and science. All scientists and scientists are now able to continue their great research to discover the secrets and dangers of the universe at the greatest possible cost.

Our civilization is being crushed. No one can stop us any longer. But a few individuals, no one but ourselves, will begin taking on the task of reclaiming the planet. And through such efforts, the Emperor will finally make it happen.

The surface temperature is measured using the current, current rate of heating, and current temperature as measured by the atmosphere.

The Sun can create up to 4 ""clouds"" as a result of its heat. This can be measured accurately in this graph. In addition to the actual increase in the sun's radiation, the total number of clouds is decreased.

The satellite can measure differences in the Earth's atmosphere and ocean from the sun. This would give a general idea of what the sun and planet have in common with each other.

He didn't get in trouble to bring the state under government pressure. He was also the best leader we have seen since the Great Depression.


Here are his most important accomplishments:


· President Barack Obama did not have a real problem with racial inequity or the way that the racial equality agenda was implemented in the states, particularly in Mississippi. He was president in 2012. That was when he pushed through the agenda and established Mississippi as the first black state.

· Obama didn't stop the implementation of this agenda, nor did he change it. He's the only president of the country to lead the nation in the way that he believes we should operate.

· Hillary Clinton is at a loss to what to do since she believes that all that's going on in the world is just good politics and not good policy.

· Hillary Clinton was a very strong candidate in 2008. She's just not that popular with the people, especially African-Americans, because she was also a Democrat, not a liberal...in 2012.

· Barack Obama was the first president to make progressive policies work for the middle class for good. He didn't bring up the economic and social issues that would lead to that success. He didn't bring up his work to make white voters look bad, to bring up the poor, but also to bring up those who might look worse at times than that at the world.

· He called for the United Nations (UN) to recognize and recognize the people of a large swath of the world as ""the great many,"" and to use their voices for progress.

But the researchers suggest that in humans, people shouldn't rely solely on the dietary component of vitamin D–which, like manganese, has been linked to cardiovascular risk–for its role in protecting against diseases like heart disease and cancer. So the research is the same as the one that's used to treat Alzheimer's, but only in some areas of the world.

""It's always interesting and a bit scary when something goes wrong while we're still learning about the disease,"" says co-lead author Matthew Shipp, a medical scientist at the University of California's Davis School of Medicine. ""I think the biggest worry is that people will think we were saving health or that vitamin D can even lead to Alzheimer's.""

In fact, a team of international scientists reported in 2014 in ""The Role of Nutrition in the Prevention of Human Dementia: A Systematic Review of the Recent Current Evidence"" that the beneficial effects of vitamin D, especially in the form of vitamin D-rich food containing natural vitamin A, have been found in rats.

The researchers used an epidemiological paradigm to assess the effects of low vitamin D, either on the prevention of Alzheimer's or the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes. As one of several studies of vitamin D-rich foods in the United States, the work involved testing blood levels of a food to gauge the concentrations and health effects of that food when administered to the population.

""Even when consuming high amounts of high-sodium foods, we never experienced significant increases in the risk of cardiovascular events like strokes and death,"" says Shipp, lead"	kill coronavirus mice, coronavirus mice researchers, heart disease cancer, disease cancer research, diabetes studies vitamin	"      Similarity Score  ...

Is it acceptable to have more children than you want? Why do women and men have the same decision making? Why does the media, the media in general, get to say it better?

It's easy to say, ""no we cannot do this as long as we don't have to,"" but this is going to make sense. Why wouldn't we have to at some point before our kids will be born?

This isn't a problem that our government, which I support, has been working on. This isn't a problem that feminists are going to be speaking against. This isn't an issue that, unfortunately, women and men are being able to see through, because it's always been difficult to deal with that. It's not an issue that they face every day living in poverty. It's not an issue that there are more rapes and assaults or the number of women who are raped. It's an issue that men have with their spouses. It's an issue that our society, when you're a woman, has never dealt with that.

But I still feel I have the right to say that when an issue is important, and I feel it should be a subject that is being debated but not that we spend millions on to keep fighting because it's wrong"	pregnant women fight, suits pregnant women, flight suits pregnant, women fight military, maternity flight suits	"      Similarity Score  ...

The Egyptian-brokered peace talks between the two groups were abruptly interrupted by clashes with gunmen in Al Quds, a district near the border with Syria, on May 3. On May 16 Egyptian troops and US forces launched aerial air strikes against the Islamist militants in Al Quds area, in what amounted to a direct attack on the Syrian border, US army spokesman 2nd Lt. James Woolsey said.

The strike killed a number of gunmen.

PEGIDA said the militants had taken up positions at checkpoints near the Syrian border. It added ""terrorist cell"" members are responsible for the strike.

A separate US-led military coalition took part in the strikes, killing an Egyptian soldier, and four others during its mission to help the Syrian government ""engage regional support forces in its defense of the city of Aleppo,"" said Col. Mike Mullen, the spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force for Operation Inherent Resolve, part of Operation Allied Force.

This week, an Islamic State affiliated group called IS claimed responsibility for the attacks.

President Bashar Assad issued two warnings for Western nations, including France, to take immediate actions to halt the flow of weapons and ammunition from Syria to Europe and bolster international support to the anti-government protesters, claiming the Syrian government had been responsible.

The Egyptian-brokered peace talks between the two groups were abruptly interrupted by clashes from the Egyptian army after the sisi movement claimed the upper house of parliament, a day before the military began its offensive against the capital of the Islamist-dominated region in which the protesters are trying to break their alliance.

Sisi won more than 600,000 supporters on Tuesday when he secured a parliamentary majority, with 53 percent supported – a sharp move after last week's landslide election victory of Egypt's first democratically elected president.

His government says both sides in the civil war cannot be allowed to continue to divide.

""With all the political developments in Egypt, it is not possible to make our peace with him secure,"" Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, one of the generals present at the meeting, told Reuters news agency early Tuesday, after talks between the military and government officials.

""We are still in the moment, and I don't think the country has been able to resolve its problems through the negotiations but that is why we have agreed to meet next time,"" he added.

Erdogan, the president, said the two sides had formed a ""coalition"" and ""unity"" in a day of emergency talks with all opposition figures.

""We are trying to understand what's happened to those who are protesting and what's happening that is unacceptable in Egypt. We don't want more violence and more chaos in our country,"" Erdogan told reporters after the meeting, on a day when the military and rebels clashed in central Cairo.

All in all, we shouldn't think any of the recent decisions made by the CDC or others should be viewed as evidence for salmanobium poisoning.

But the CDC has taken this position with alarming regularity. The agency is pushing the position the public supports based on the same arguments made in the scientific literature, which is that salmanobium is a neurotoxin. And they have failed to mention that they were using the same scientific method in their analysis of the human populations exposed to the salmanobium.

Salmanobium poisoning causes mild depression, seizures, vomiting, fever and headache. Most serious illness occurs shortly after exposure to Salmanobium, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, and with symptoms like chest pain, vomiting, drowsiness and nausea. Salmanobium poisoning can cause severe, life-threatening depression and seizures.

As we pointed out in our recent article, the only indication that the public believes salmanobium should be taken in high concentrations is from the American Medical Association's report on the effects of chlorhexidine, which the agency has not endorsed.

The American Medical Association did not endorse its own evaluation of salmanobium poisoning and it didn't even provide recommendations for potential long term effects. When CDC's health ministry declared salmanobium neurotoxin unacceptable and recommended taking it as well, they said the study couldn't support salmanobium's safety.

There is no way we can determine whether or not the CDC's decision was based on science, as their findings can be found in a scientific paper.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen’s Houthi group said it had intercepted a drone on Tuesday fired by the Iran-aligned group towards the kingdom but that it had left shrapnel in the vicinity of Saudi’s Abha airport, state media reported. The explosive-laden drone had been fired towards Abha airport, which is in southern Saudi Arabia near the Yemen border. But when the tabloids put the blame on Meghan instead, Meghan said the royal family didn't correct the record, something Meghan called a ""turning point"" in her relationship with the royals. The gravity of the claims has raised questions about how the British monarchy, which survived centuries of revolution that toppled their cousins across Europe, could function in a meritocratic world. Meghan then says: ""I don't know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that the firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.

But the researchers suggest that in humans, people shouldn't rely solely on the dietary component of vitamin D–which, like manganese, has been linked to cardiovascular risk–for its role in protecting against diseases like heart disease and cancer. So the research is the same as the one that's used to treat Alzheimer's, but only in some areas of the world.

""It's always interesting and a bit scary when something goes wrong while we're still learning about the disease,"" says co-lead author Matthew Shipp, a medical scientist at the University of California's Davis School of Medicine. ""I think the biggest worry is that people will think we were saving health or that vitamin D can even lead to Alzheimer's.""

In fact, a team of international scientists reported in 2014 in ""The Role of Nutrition in the Prevention of Human Dementia: A Systematic Review of the Recent Current Evidence"" that the beneficial effects of vitamin D, especially in the form of vitamin D-rich food containing natural vitamin A, have been found in rats.

The researchers used an epidemiological paradigm to assess the effects of low vitamin D, either on the prevention of Alzheimer's or the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes. As one of several studies of vitamin D-rich foods in the United States, the work involved testing blood levels of a food to gauge the concentrations and health effects of that food when administered to the population.

Though he was no Washington or Lincoln, Trump amended the informal Constitution in at least five significant ways. Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele had a terse message Monday for conservatives who would leave the Republican Party to follow former President Donald Trump. No president shall be removed from office for treason, bribery, or any other crime or misdemeanor, no matter how high, should a partisan minority of the Senate choose to protect him. The results of the poll show just how deeply Trump’s rhetoric has embedded itself within the party, Steele said. Until Trump came along, the process had been used only twice, in 1868 and 1998, for Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

To prevent the viral genome from replicating, scientists have focused upon creating the best synthetic polymerase from non-RNA sequence.


Here are the steps to make your own polymerase:


1. Cut and cut. Cut-and-paste the raw RNA in any of your sources:

1) Use a long straight razor to cut the mRNA into smaller chunks.

2) Take a little piece of newspaper – called a ""papercut"" – and cut down the number of nucleotides. (Try to use only one sample per body.)


3) Cut the RNA into smaller chunks. Take 4 pieces. Fold them in half and form a long sheet of paper. Cover with a cloth. Cut a sheet of paper to create the same pattern of DNA strands that you were going to cover.


4) Cut the RNAs into the same pattern as the first sample.

5) Divide the DNA into smaller pieces and form an identical pattern of DNA strands

6) Divide the RNA into smaller pieces and form an identical pattern of DNA strands

7) Divide the DNA into smaller pieces and form an identical pattern of DNA strands


8) Divide the DNA into smaller pieces and form an identical sequence of DNA strand

9) Put the RNA into the second test

10) Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each sequence that you've put in.

This was confirmed in the case of the BVI-2 pandemic that killed over 300 million people, from 11th to 11th March. The new evidence of the BVI-2 infection with the bacterium and the high mortality is consistent with the low cost of the new evidence. We have also concluded that BVI-2 could take advantage of a number of new pathogens being introduced into the human population. The BVI-2 case is still a very controversial research question, though we have used several methods to determine the link between BVI and human disease and the data set of the Chinese case is strong. We now know that BVI-2 is present in every cell of humans, at a population level, in over one billion individuals worldwide. We also know that it is spread by infectious agents that are carried by humans. This results in a potential link between BVI-2 infection and the human pandemic that is now estimated to cost the United States $9 billion. In the case of the BVI pandemic in 2012 the CDC confirmed that BVI-2 was present throughout the whole world throughout the whole world. The high rate of BVI-2 infection from BVI-2 is currently low, making it possible for the human pandemic to be prevented without BVI. The high rate of BVI-2 in the Asian food crisis has been estimated to result from low health insurance coverage of Asian populations and the continued poor quality of healthy diets (reviewed in S. and K. Fung and G. C. Sibley and Y. Yalsson, Science (2009), p. 588-894).

To be clear, it is not hard to see why investors want to buy the bitcoin in 2020 or 2030 - to avoid the price bubble after 2020. The key question now is how exactly the market looks at this. The big news is that the Bitcoin-DAO situation is in trouble. The price has moved so far in that direction that it is very likely that the market will stop being profitable when prices fall.

A little research conducted by the University of Copenhagen and MIT indicates that the price of bitcoin is approaching this equilibrium: The market is being made more aggressive and likely to stop as soon as the markets see the market moving.

There have been lots of attempts at doing this. This is a good reason for thinking that Bitcoin is a perfect example why you can create a Bitcoin-DAO which is as secure as Google Now. What this has shown is that you can create an algorithm which can be fully trust protected against censorship.

Another problem is that there are not enough software developers to create such a new program which is very time consuming and costly. This is an issue that is being fixed soon (but not yet). The problems will continue for years to come. As bitcoin continues to grow as a business and will continue to build and operate much more seamlessly with software developers as the market continues to grow - then it is very likely that it will crash and all the hype about it that you've been seeing."	bitcoin going decline, bitcoin 2020 2030, bitcoin approaching equilibrium, market stop profitable, price bubble 2020	"      Similarity Score  ...

A bat-eater is a creature that looks like a human cat or dog. This is one of those little creatures that is often mistaken for a mongoose.

The corona virus then infects your brain. A vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health in 2003 was used to treat corona fever in mice, some of whom developed fever because of the virus. The vaccine stopped the corona-causing infection in humans three years later, according to research published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases.

The study is part of a national project to test the safety of vaccines to people who have recently contracted Ebola. The center plans to distribute vaccine-supplemented products, including a single dose of anti-Ebola strains, that are to help people infected with Ebola, which is still spread through direct contact with food, water or air, in Africa.

A CDC spokesman told CNN that CDC researchers are still in the early stages of conducting this study. The study has been approved by the N.I.H. and is scheduled to be published later this year to assess whether the vaccine can prevent the virus from spreading to patients infected with the human virus. The CDC would not disclose who contributed to the study, but it is well established with other infectious diseases that viral scientists can use to detect, diagnose and treat a disease.

Bozeman's office and Zumwalt Medical Center don't have any additional details beyond his statement.

There are roughly 20,000 cases of Ebola in the U.S.; many occur among children and adults because the virus is transmitted through blood, semen or breathing.

Astonishingly, in his inauguration speech he thanked President Harry Truman for the ""great success"" of the US. He said: ""In 1945, the United States of America had been the most prosperous nation in history with a small and rapidly growing middle-class."" He added: ""America is now richer … and richer than ever before … We are now more prosperous than in 1945.""

This is a great speech!

It is absolutely astounding that we have never seen an Obama administration be so excited about the ""great success"" of the U.S. and how much more ""great success"" can be achieved by the ""great success"" we make up. Why does it matter? This is a great president, who will never win a war, will always have a political agenda, will always be able to make the case for universal healthcare, will always be able to make a case that we can build on the greatness that we share with the world, but only if he gets Congress to give us more help on our tax structure, the entitlement programs that benefit all Americans and the way that they receive our benefits (but what they do not provide, the wealthy benefit from more generous benefits and even the very rich get less than anyone knows) - and if Congress decides to pass a plan that would require no more, then America, but also the great nation, will never be better or more productive that some other world leader.

Here are more of his more touching speeches from his White House:

But the researchers suggest that in humans, people shouldn't rely solely on the dietary component of vitamin D–which, like manganese, has been linked to cardiovascular risk–for its role in protecting against diseases like heart disease and cancer. So the research is the same as the one that's used to treat Alzheimer's, but only in some areas of the world.

""It's always interesting and a bit scary when something goes wrong while we're still learning about the disease,"" says co-lead author Matthew Shipp, a medical scientist at the University of California's Davis School of Medicine. ""I think the biggest worry is that people will think we were saving health or that vitamin D can even lead to Alzheimer's.""

In fact, a team of international scientists reported in 2014 in ""The Role of Nutrition in the Prevention of Human Dementia: A Systematic Review of the Recent Current Evidence"" that the beneficial effects of vitamin D, especially in the form of vitamin D-rich food containing natural vitamin A, have been found in rats.

The researchers used an epidemiological paradigm to assess the effects of low vitamin D, either on the prevention of Alzheimer's or the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes. As one of several studies of vitamin D-rich foods in the United States, the work involved testing blood levels of a food to gauge the concentrations and health effects of that food when administered to the population.

Thus, the relationship between corona and the viral load can shift quickly.

The researchers also tested to see what effect they were seeing on the virus's growth.

""We know that there are specific types of viral viruses, but their viral function is not the same as the virion function,"" said study researcher Christopher Jones, Ph.D., a professor in the Center for Infection and Immunity at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

""As you get older, the virus is known to show a different type of function.""

Using the data from bats, the team used several methods to compare the size, activity and genetic makeup of corona viruses.

""That data revealed what kind of corona viruses are present in many bats in the same individual,"" said Jones.

The findings confirmed that bats use a genetic mutation, known as a mutation that brings the corona virus to the adult as well, that increases the virion capacity of the virus, which helps it spread.

The researchers also found that bats also consume the virus's nutrients. The team estimated that about two-thirds of the virus's calories come from the corona virus.

At first, the vaccine was ineffective, but it didn't prevent the virus's symptoms.

""So when you do a long-term trial, how do you explain that vaccination program that you've lost?"" Jones asked. ""So that's kind of where this is heading.""

The following is excerpted from ""The American Economy And Growth: A Presidential Companion"" by Gary R. Van Buren (Parsons Press, 2003).


The American economy continues to grow, and in fact it does so at a substantially higher pace. The Federal Reserve Chairman's report that this is the fastest growing economy of the last 70 years concluded in September of 2015: ""The economy has expanded at a rate of 4.2 percent annually over the last three years, at a population of just under 30 million people...

The labor force in the United States grew at a faster pace today than it did in 2007, expanding at a population of approximately 34 million people.


Economists have pointed out that the rapid expansion of the labor market shows the economy has been growing at a similar rapid pace in the past two decades that has been sustained in the past four decades.""


In the wake of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve released a report that found that the U.S.'s ""economic recovery is clearly heading in the right direction."" The report concluded,


""Economic activity, at its best, is at full potential and expected to continue to grow at a remarkable rate.

The fact that all the sharks were able to survive at sea gives those scientists a much-needed boost. Researchers who have seen the world's first recorded sharks had a better idea of how these creatures lived.

The team's breakthrough came from taking samples from these sharks and placing them in a laboratory box on beaches – a method that helps scientists detect the presence of other organisms. The scientists also placed the sharks on artificial reefs.

""This shows that the large number of sharks is a positive signal to many scientists,"" says Prof. James Raddatzky, lead author of the paper.

""With all the knowledge in regards to the evolution of social animals, this would be one of the first results to emerge from our research. We are already starting to understand what makes the social groups important."" This has implications not only for biodiversity but for our understanding of human behavior, says Raddatzky, author of the paper and editor of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

past Number Ones artist Freddie And The Dreamers later covered it and turned it into a top-five hit in the UK  Record shopping in Benton, George Harrison found a James Ray album that hadn’t come out the UK  He bought it, and he didn’t much like it, but one song stuck with him  One of Ray’s singles was a big, juicy R&B song that sounded more like big-band jazz than like rock ‘n’ roll  The song was called “Got My Mind Set On You ” Ray’s version of the song had come out as a single, but it hadn’t charted  Clark was an aspiring songwriter who worked as a mailman in New York, and he heard Ray singing in a small club  Clark started writing songs for Ray  One of those songs was “If You Gotta Make A Fool Of Somebody,” Ray’s first single, and it was a hit How many songs did Pattie Boyd — fashion model, photographer, muse, and wife of George Harrison and Eric Clapton — inspire? It’s hard to say, since some of the lyrics purportedly written for her, like those in Harrison’s breakout “Something,” may have been for someone else, then diplomatically attributed to Boyd  Or, in the case of “Something” — the first Harrison song to come out as a Beatles A-side single and the song that convinced the world of his formidable songwriting talents — they might have been about a big, blue supernatural something  According to Joe Taysom at Far Out magazine, Harrison “became obsessive in his studies of Krishna Consciousness when he wrote the song, and more specifically, its original intent was as a devotion to Lord Krishna How many songs did Pattie Boyd — fashion model, photographer, muse, and wife of George Harrison and Eric Clapton — inspire?

'f1': 0.0}	0.7	"A lot of worry has been triggered by discoveries that variants of the pandemic-causing coronavirus can be more infectious than the original  By studying the blood of COVID survivors and people who have been vaccinated, immunologists are learning that some of our immune system cells—which remember past infections and react to them—might have their own abilities to change, countering mutations in the virus  “Essentially, the immune system is trying to get ahead of the virus,” says Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at the Rockefeller University, who conducted some recent studies that tracked this phenomenon  The emerging idea is that the body maintains reserve armies of antibody-producing cells in addition to the original cells that responded to the initial invasion by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID The coronavirus is likely to have emerged in bats and spread to another animal before it jumped into the human population, according to a study from the World Health Organization and Chinese scientists that is scheduled to be released Tuesday  The 123-page report, which NBC News obtained ahead of its release, also found that it s ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus leaked from a lab, a theory that has flourished among China skeptics even though it is based largely on circumstantial evidence  Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  The findings are the result of a joint study by Chinese scientists and a WHO-led team that was in China last month to investigate the virus s origin  The inquiry has been the center of political tensions from its start; Biden administration officials have faulted China for what they say is a lack of transparency about how the virus emerged  Other critics said the inquiry was insufficient because many of the Chinese scientists involved with it are affiliated with government-run institutions and because the investigators didn t have full access to lab records and raw data It could have been career suicide for scientists to voice suspicions about a possible lab leak, says Metzl, especially when there was already a long history of viral disease outbreaks spilling over from nature  She herself has spent much of the last year calling for more scrutiny of a potential lab leak, claiming that as a postdoc, she has less to lose  The vitriol also obscures a broader imperative, Relman says, which is that uncovering the virus’s origins is crucial to stopping the next pandemic  Threats from both lab accidents and natural spillovers are growing simultaneously as humans move steadily into wild places and new biosafety labs grow in number around the world ”  In a statement, Trump said that  “I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) Vaccine, that if I wasn’t President, you wouldn’t be getting that beautiful ‘shot’ for 5 years, at best, and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all,” read a statement from the former president  The actual time frame to produce a safe and effective vaccine takes anywhere from 10-15 years and sometimes even longer because of the complex nature of testing along with various rules and regulations led by government agencies in collaboration with multi-national pharmaceutical companies and they still in many cases, are untrustworthy  The labs predicted that a commercial vaccine could be available for emergency or compassionate use by early 2021—incredibly fast, given that vaccines to brand-new pathogens have taken a decade to be perfected and deployed  The article explains how the Ebola vaccine took at least 5 years before any trials, “even the Ebola vaccine, which was fast-tracked, took five years to reach widespread trials  What is interesting is that the article itself admits that there has been several labs who created gene-based vaccines for other viruses in the past, but none have been “commercialized for a human illness ” Instead of using the traditional way of creating a vaccine, (although most vaccines still have many problems regardless of how safe Big Pharma claims they are) they went along with the new gene-based approach of creating a different kind of vaccine as they explain:  Scientists use information from the genome of the virus to create a blueprint of select antigens  The cell’s machinery uses the instructions to make virus antigens that the immune system reacts to Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, China and its rivals have been locked in a battle over the origins of the virus, with the US in particular pushing a theory that it was a weapon engineered in a Wuhan lab  At first, transmission from hunted game seemed likely, but Beijing has also said the cold chain could have brought the virus from elsewhere  The long-anticipated report from a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China’s Wuhan has found that it’s “extremely unlikely” that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, escaped from a research lab  It advised further research into every area of inquiry, but noted the theory that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from the Wuhan Virology Lab has the least credibility As a World Health Organization and Chinese study into the origins of the pandemic gives no conclusive answers, the controversial theory that the virus emerged from a lab refuses to go away  After a month of gathering information in China, and even longer turning the findings into a 120-page report, an international team of experts on Tuesday delivered its conclusions on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic  The bottom line: We still don’t know where SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, came from — and it’s possible we never will  The most likely explanation, according to experts convened by the World Health Organization and the Chinese government, is that the coronavirus transmitted from its natural animal host to people via an intermediate wild species that was farmed for food  They rated a competing theory that the virus escaped in an accident at a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan as “extremely unlikely” — but devoted less than two pages of the report to that possibility  Some scientists criticized the report, which provides new details about what Chinese authorities did to try to find the source of the virus, but leaves many important questions unanswered  Efforts to identify the natural or intermediate animal hosts for the virus have so far drawn a blank  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told member countries on Tuesday that the study didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab leak, according to Bloomberg  We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do ” Following the release of the report on Tuesday, the US State Department issued a statement on behalf of the US and 13 other countries, writing, “We voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples  And, crucially, the study was not the forensic investigation that some scientists have called for — going through freezers, databases, records of field sampling, and lab notes to probe the controversial theory that the virus escaped in an accident at a lab in the city of Wuhan  He had collaborated for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sampling coronaviruses from bats and assessing the threat that they could cause a pandemic  For more than a year, he has described explanations involving a lab release as “conspiracy theories  With then-president Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, both claiming they had evidence, without providing any details, that the virus came from the Wuhan lab, Daszak’s grant from the National Institutes of Health to collaborate with the agency was abruptly terminated  The resulting political polarization turned the lab origin idea into a third rail that many scientists didn’t want to touch  After Chinese scientists posted a draft genome of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the disease culprit in Wuhan, Petrovksy — who by this time had put skiing on the backburner to work from his Colorado home office — directed his colleagues down under to run computer modeling studies of the viral sequence, a first step towards designing a vaccine  As Petrovsky considered whether SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged in lab cultures with human cells, or cells engineered to express the human ACE2 protein, a letter penned by 27 scientists appeared suddenly on Feb  Convened by the WHO, and closely monitored by Chinese authorities, the team concluded initially that a lab leak was so unlikely that further investigations of it were unnecessary ” A group of 26 scientists, social scientists, and science communicators — Petrovksy among them — have now signed their own letter arguing that WHO investigators lacked “the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses” to determine whether or not SARS-CoV-2 could have been the result of a laboratory incident  Chinese officials were, and still are, unwilling to provide information that might settle lingering questions about where the virus came from, and in the absence of critical data, expert views coalesced around two competing scenarios: One that a lab leak was plausible and needed more scrutiny, and another that SARS-CoV-2 had almost certainly spilled over from nature and that the odds of a lab leak were so remote that the possibility could essentially be taken off the table  Those insisting on a natural origin say the virus lacks genetic features that would show it to have been deliberately engineered  But it’s also possible that SARS-CoV-2 evolved naturally in the wild before it was brought into a lab to be studied, only to subsequently escape  The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which many see as the likeliest site of a breakout, houses one of the largest collections of coronaviruses in the world  David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, says a lab leak was never the subject of a “fair and dispassionate discussion of the facts as we know them ” Instead, tempers soon began to flare as those calling for a closer look at possible lab origins were dismissed as conspiracy theorists spouting misinformation  Attacks on Asian Americans had been escalating since the pandemic began, and with then-President Trump fuming about a “Chinese virus,” many scientists and reporters became “cautious about saying anything that might justify the rhetoric of his administration,” says Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Washington, D  Immunologist Nikolai Petrovsky studies viruses and develops vaccines and adjuvants  He has pushed back against the idea that considering whether or not SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin is a conspiracy theory  Visual: Vaxine Pty Ltd / Flinders University  It could have been career suicide for scientists to voice suspicions about a possible lab leak, says Metzl, especially when there was already a long history of viral disease outbreaks spilling over from nature  Robert Redfield at a White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing on Nov  Robert Redfield, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), says that he believes the novel coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, according to news reports  In an interview with CNN released Friday (March 26), Redfield stressed that this was his ""opinion"" on the origins of the virus, and he did not cite any evidence for that theory  If everyone knew that these remedies were readily available, highly effective and practically free, who would risk their life for a vaccine? Virtually no one  In short, Vanden Bossche fears these experimental vaccines, which do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus, will foster the development of “dangerous variants” that will be far more lethal to the unvaccinated and vaccinated alike, who, for different reasons, will not have sufficient immunity to protect them ”  Last December, Yeadon, a British national, filed a petition with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to immediately suspend testing on these experimental vaccines due to many safety concerns, including pathogenic priming, which involves “an exaggerated immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, ‘wild’ virus after vaccination ”  In their white paper on the topic, AFLDS warned that such reactions, which can be fatal, “are difficult to prove,” as they are often interpreted as infection with “a worse virus,” or, perhaps, a more dangerous variant  This is madness, because even if these agents were legitimate, protection is needed only by those at notably elevated risk of death from the virus  “But all the other people, those in good health and younger than 60 years, perhaps a little older, they don’t perish from the virus "	pandemic causing coronavirus, causing coronavirus infectious, virology sampling coronaviruses, coverage coronavirus outbreak, novel coronavirus sars	"     Similarity Score  ...
